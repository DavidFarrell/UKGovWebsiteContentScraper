The father or pregnant woman\u2019s partner has the right to unpaid time off work to go to 2 antenatal appointments.\n\n## Pregnancy-related illnesses\n\nMaternity leave and Statutory Maternity Pay will start automatically if the employee is off work for a pregnancy-related illness in the 4 weeks before the baby is due - it does not matter what has been previously agreed.\n\n## Compulsory maternity leave\n\nIf the employee is not taking Statutory Maternity Leave, they must take 2 weeks off after the baby is born - or 4 weeks if they work in a factory.\n\n## Telling the employer about the pregnancy\n\nEmployees must tell their employer about the pregnancy at least 15 weeks before the beginning of the week the baby is due.\n\nIf this is not possible (for example because they did not know they were pregnant) the employer must be told as soon as possible.\n\nEmployees must also tell the employer when they want to start their [Statutory Maternity Leave](/maternity-pay-leave/leave) and [Statutory Maternity Pay](/maternity-pay-leave/pay).\n\nEmployees cannot take time off for antenatal appointments until they\u2019ve told the employer about the pregnancy.\n\n## Health and safety for pregnant employees\n\nWhen the employee tells their employer they\u2019re pregnant, the employer should assess the risks to the employee and their baby.\n\nRisks could be caused by:\n\n  * heavy lifting or carrying\n  * standing or sitting for long periods without adequate breaks\n  * exposure to toxic substances\n  * long working hours\n\n\n\nWhere there are risks, the employer should take reasonable steps to remove them. For example, offering the employee different work or changing their hours.\n\nThe employer should [suspend the employee on full pay](/running-payroll/payments) if they cannot remove any risks. For example, offering suitable alternative work.\n\nFor [full details about the regulations](https://www.hse.gov.uk/mothers/employer/workplace-safety-law.htm) see the Health and Safety Executive website.\n\nPregnant employees who think they\u2019re at risk but their employer disagrees should talk to their health and safety or trade union representative. If your employer still refuses to do anything, talk to your doctor or contact the [Health and Safety Executive.](http://www.hse.gov.uk/contact/index.htm)\n\n## Pregnancy and maternity discrimination\n\nIt is against the law to discriminate against anyone because of being pregnant.\n\nRead the Acas guide on [pregnancy and maternity discrimination](https://www.acas.org.uk/managing-your-employees-maternity-leave-and-pay/discrimination-because-of-pregnancy-or-maternity) for more information.\n\nPregnant employees have the right to be offered a suitable alternative job (if one is available) if they\u2019re selected for redundancy. This applies even if other colleagues are more suitable for the role.\n\nThe right starts from the date the employee tells their employer they\u2019re pregnant and lasts for up to 18 months from the date the child is born. If the pregnancy ends early and the employee does not have the right to statutory maternity leave, the right lasts for 2 weeks after the end of the pregnancy.\n\nFind out about [employee rights when taking maternity leave and returning to work](/employee-rights-when-on-leave).",

      "body": "Employee rights are not usually affected when taking:\n\n  * maternity leave\n  * paternity leave\n  * adoption leave\n  * parental leave\n  * parental bereavement leave\n  * Shared Parental Leave\n\n\n\nSome employees can work up to 10 paid days (20 days for Shared Parental Leave) during their leave.\n\n## Keeping in touch days\n\nEmployees can work up to 10 days during their maternity or adoption leave. These days are called \u2018keeping in touch days\u2019. Keeping in touch days are optional - both the employee and employer need to agree to them.\n\nThe type of work and pay employees get should be agreed before they come into work. The employee\u2019s right to maternity or adoption leave and pay is not affected by taking keeping in touch days.\n\nEmployees can work up to 20 days during their Shared Parental Leave. These are called \u2018shared parental leave in touch\u2019 (or SPLIT) days. These days are in addition to the 10 \u2018keeping in touch\u2019 (or KIT) days already available to employees on maternity or adoption leave.\n\n## Terms and conditions protection\n\nNormally, the employment terms and conditions are protected and employees are entitled to any pay rises and improvements in terms and conditions given during the leave.\n\nPension contributions usually stop if a period of leave is unpaid, unless your contract says otherwise. For example, during unpaid periods of maternity leave or parental leave.\n\nEmployees continue to build up holiday entitlement and can take any holiday they\u2019ve accrued (built up) before or after the leave.\n\n## Returning to work\n\nEmployees have the right to return to their job if they take:\n\n  * paternity leave\n  * only 26 weeks of maternity or adoption leave\n  * only 26 weeks of Shared Parental Leave (between both parents)\n  * 4 weeks or less of unpaid parental leave\n  * Parental Bereavement Leave\n\n\n\n### If employees take more leave\n\nIf the employee takes more leave they\u2019ll have the right to their job or a similar job (if it\u2019s not possible to give them their old job).\n\nSimilar means the job has the same or better terms and conditions. If the employee unreasonably refuses to take the similar job the employer can take this as their resignation.\n\n## Redundancy\n\nEmployees have the right to be offered a suitable alternative job (where one is available) if they\u2019re selected for redundancy when they take:\n\n  * maternity leave\n  * adoption leave\n  * at least 6 continuous weeks Shared Parental Leave\n\n\n\nThis applies even if other colleagues are more suitable for the role.\n\nThe right lasts for 18 months from the date the child is born or adopted and continues when the employee returns to work. For example, an employee returning from maternity leave 12 months after the birth of their child will have the same right for 6 months after returning to work.\n\nSome employees only have the right to be offered a suitable alternative job up until they return to work. This applies if an employee:\n\n  * is taking less than 6 continuous weeks Shared Parental Leave\n  * returned to work before 6 April 2024\n\n\n\nAn employee can only be made redundant if the employer can clearly justify doing it - for example a part of the business closes and everyone in that section is made redundant. There are other [rules for employers](/staff-redundant) when making staff redundant.",

You can [watch a video about using the app to manage your tax credits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H-h-HqVnMI).\n\n## Changes you cannot report online\n\nYou cannot use the online service or HMRC app to report changes:\n\n  * to how often you want to be paid\n  * that have not yet happened (apart from changes to existing childcare costs up to one week in advance)\n\n\n\nYou can [report these and other changes by phone or post](/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/tax-credits-enquiries).\n\n## Before you start\n\nMake sure you have as much information as possible about the change in circumstances. For example, if you\u2019ve changed jobs you\u2019ll need your employment dates and PAYE reference number for both jobs.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to sign in to use this service. If you do not already have sign in details, you\u2019ll be able to create them.\n\nYou\u2019ll be told when you sign in if you need to prove your identity. This is to keep your details safe and usually involves using photo ID like a passport or driving licence.\n\nSigning in will also activate your personal tax account - you can use this to check and manage your HMRC records.\n\n## Why your tax credits change\n\nYour payments will stop if:\n\n  * you or your partner make a claim for Universal Credit (even if your claim is not approved)\n  * you claimed as a single person and you start living with a partner\n  * you claimed as a couple and you split from your partner\n\n\n\nYour payments can go down or stop if:\n\n  * your income goes up by more than \u00a32,500 - report this straight away to reduce the amount you\u2019re overpaid\n  * you have not [renewed your claim](/renewing-your-tax-credits-claim)\n  * your award notice shows you\u2019ve been overpaid\n  * you stop being eligible for the [disability element](/government/publications/tax-credits-disability-helpsheet-tc956) of your tax credit claim\n  * your child is now 16, 18 or 19 and you have not told HMRC they\u2019re in [approved education or training](/child-tax-credit-when-child-reaches-16)\n  * your childcare costs go down\n\n\n\nYour payments can go up if:\n\n  * your income goes down by more than \u00a32,500\n  * your benefits stop or go down\n  * you start being eligible for the [disability element](/government/publications/tax-credits-disability-helpsheet-tc956) of tax credits\n  * you have a child\n  * your childcare costs go up\n\n\n  *[HMRC]: HM Revenue and Customs\n  *[PAYE]: Pay As You Earn",

Access codes are 13 characters long and start with a V, for example, V-AB12-CD34-EF56. \n\nAccess codes can only be given over the phone, they cannot be sent by post. \n\nOnce confirmed, HMRC will then be able to update their tax records and discuss tax queries with the person helping you.\n\nIn some cases HMRC may also need either an original or certified copy of the LPA. They will say if this is the case. \n\n### Tell HMRC about the power of attorney by post\n\nThe person helping you can tell HMRC by sending either: \n\n  * an original copy of the LPA\n  * a certified copy of the LPA\n\n\n\nFind out [how to certify a copy of an LPA](/power-of-attorney/certify) or [how to certify other types of power of attorney](/certifying-a-document).\n\nIf they\u2019re in the UK and you want them to manage your tax credits, they can send the original or certified copy to:\n\nTax Credit Office   \nIAA Team 2, Area E   \nSt Mark\u2019s House   \nSt Mary\u2019s Street   \nPreston   \nPR1 4AT   \n\n\nIf they\u2019re in the UK and you want them to manage any other tax affairs, they can send the original or certified copy to:\n\nPay As You Earn and Self Assessment   \nHM Revenue and Customs   \nBX9 1AS   \nUnited Kingdom   \n\n\nIf they\u2019re outside of the UK and you want them to manage any tax affairs, they can send the original or certified copy to:\n\nHM Revenue and Customs   \nBenton Park View   \nNewcastle Upon Tyne   \nNE98 1ZZ   \n\n\nThe copy will be returned to them. After that, if they sent in a letter with the copy, they should get a reply letter from HMRC. They should not need to send in a copy again, unless the details of the power of attorney change.\n  *[HMRC]: HM Revenue and Customs\n  *[LPA]: Lasting power of attorney",

      "body": "For some employees you need to consider which earnings should be used in the average weekly earnings calculation before you can use the calculator.\n\n## Agency workers and casual (or short contract) employees\n\nThere are different rules for casual (or short contract) employees and agency workers.\n\n## Agency workers\n\nYou can treat agency workers as employees for PAYE tax and Class 1 National Insurance contributions (NICs). If you deduct PAYE tax and Class 1 NICs from the agency worker\u2019s earnings, or would do if they were high enough, then you must pay them Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) if they satisfy the qualifying conditions.\n\n## Agricultural workers\n\nThe Agricultural Wages Board in England was abolished on 1 October 2013.\n\nSince then agricultural workers in England who aren\u2019t covered by the terms and conditions of the Agricultural Wages Board have been eligible for statutory payments if they meet the appropriate qualifying conditions.\n\n## Casual and short contract employees\n\nA casual employee is usually someone who works for an employer, as and when they\u2019re needed on a series of short contracts of employment with that person. These casual workers may also be called short contract employees. If you have to deduct PAYE tax and Class 1 NICs from the worker\u2019s earnings, then you\u2019ll have to pay them SMP if they satisfy all the qualifying conditions.\n\n## Mariners\n\nMariners can get SMP if you have a place of business in the UK and they\u2019re on a home-trade ship.\n\n## NHS employees\n\nSome NHS employees whose contracts are split between Strategic Health Authorities and NHS trusts, as a result of NHS reorganisation, can choose to have all their earnings added together for working out Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) for SMP purposes.\n\nHowever, if an employee changes from one trust to another during the 26 weeks qualifying rule, the employee may not satisfy the continuous employment rule for SMP purposes.\n\nFor further advice Email: [doctorsanddentists@nhsemployers.org](mailto:doctorsanddentists@nhsemployers.org)\n\n## Supply teachers, seasonal workers or other sporadic employment\n\nSupply teachers, seasonal workers and other employees who work as and when you need them may not have worked for you in every week:\n\n  * from the latest start date for employment with you\n  * up to and including the Sunday of the Qualifying Week (QW)\n\n\n\nFor SMP in this instance, a week means Sunday to Saturday, as a week means different things in different contexts. Count part weeks as full weeks.\n\nIf they:\n\n  * worked for you in every week they\u2019ll satisfy the employment condition\n  * didn\u2019t work for you in every week you need to check why not\n\n\n\nThey can still get SMP if they didn\u2019t work if:\n\n  * they were on paid leave, or you didn\u2019t have work to offer them\n  * you offered them work and they turned it down but you must check the reason why they turned down the work\n\n\n\n## Directors\n\nCompanies are required to keep [records](https://www.gov.uk/running-a-limited-company/company-and-accounting-records) of shareholder votes and resolutions. Evidence of these will be requested to determine entitlement and recovery of SMP.\n\n### Companies incorporated before 1 October 2009\n\nThe previous standard articles, which apply in default, continue to apply. An ordinary resolution is required to determine director\u2019s remuneration. The method of calculating director\u2019s remuneration by an annual figure (after an ordinary resolution has been passed by shareholders) will apply to these companies. Any payments made in anticipation of the annual vote can\u2019t be taken into account for calculating AWE.\n\n### Companies incorporated after 1 October 2009\n\nThere are new regulations for companies incorporated after 1 October 2009. They provide new Articles of Association for these companies and will:\n\n  * default if other articles aren\u2019t adopted\n  * allow its directors to determine a director\u2019s remuneration\n\n\n\nDirectors can decide what remuneration to pay and when. There\u2019s no need for a resolution of the companies shareholders at its Annual General Meeting (AGM). In such cases payment of director\u2019s fees will be regarded as earnings for the purpose of entitlement to SMP on the date payment was made and the SMP calculator used in the normal way.\n\n#### Paid contractually\n\nIf the director is contractually paid a regular salary, their AWE are calculated like any other employee.\n\n#### Paid by a determination of the directors (not a formal vote)\n\nCalculate the AWE by adding together the monies paid and any other payments of earnings, but use the date monies were paid instead of the date of the shareholders\u2019 resolution at the AGM to determine the total earnings during the relevant period.\n\n#### Paid both contractually and by formal vote\n\nA director who is paid contractually may also be paid a bonus or fees by a formal vote. You must still calculate their AWE like any other employee, but you should only include the monies voted by formal vote if the date of the vote falls in the relevant period.\n\n#### Paid only by a formal vote\n\nIf the director is paid only by a formal vote calculate their AWE in the usual way, substituting the dates of the formal votes in place of the normal paydays.\n\nA formal vote usually takes place at the company\u2019s AGM and is agreed in the company minutes.\n\n#### Monies drawn in anticipation of a formal vote\n\nSome directors may regularly draw money from the business in anticipation of a formal vote. Don\u2019t include this money when working out the director\u2019s AWE, even if NICs were deducted at the time they were paid.\n\n## Employee has more than one job with you\n\nIf you add together all the employee\u2019s earnings to work out Class 1 NICs you must add them together to calculate the employee\u2019s AWE, and the employee can only get one amount of SMP. In this case, they should take the same time off from each job otherwise they\u2019ll lose some of their SMP because they\u2019re working for you.\n\nIf Class 1 NICs are worked out separately on the employee\u2019s earnings, then you must calculate their AWE separately, as the employee can get more than one amount of SMP.\n\nIn this case, they can choose to take different times off from each job without losing any SMP. This is because SMP entitlement is treated completely separately under each contract when earnings aren\u2019t added together to work out NICs.\n\n## Employee has more than one job\n\nIf a woman has more than one job, only one maternity certificate can be issued showing the expected date. They need to agree with one employer what other evidence will be accepted to confirm the date the baby is due.\n\nYour employee can either:\n\n  * show one employer the original MATB1 maternity certificate, which the employer can photocopy and then note the copy that the original has been seen and this is a true copy of the original which can then be given back to the employee for use by the other employer\n  * provide a letter which includes the pregnant woman\u2019s name and the date of confinement which must be stamped and signed by a doctor or midwife and if signed by a midwife, must have the midwife\u2019s PIN and expiry of registration date\n\n\n\n## Employee works abroad\n\nIf your employee works for you outside the UK from the latest start date for employment with you, and up to and including the Sunday of the QW they can get SMP.\n\nIf you weren\u2019t liable to pay Class 1 NICs throughout that period and they worked for you in the European Economic Area (EEA), they may still get SMP if you:\n\n  * were liable to pay Class 1 NICs on their earnings throughout that period, or would have been if their earnings had been high enough\n  * weren\u2019t liable to pay Class 1 NICs throughout that period and they worked for you in the EEA, but they worked for you in the UK in the QW, and you were liable to pay Class 1 NICs on their earnings for that week, or would have been if their earnings had been high enough\n\n\n  *[NICs]: National Insurance contributions\n  *[SMP]: Statutory Maternity Pay\n  *[AWE]: Average Weekly Earnings\n  *[QW]: Qualifying Week\n  *[AGM]: Annual General Meeting\n  *[EEA]: European Economic Area",

      "body": "If you or your organisation offer work experience, including \u2018placements\u2019 and internships, you need to consider if the person who will work for you is entitled to the National Minimum Wage (NMW) or National Living Wage (NLW). Both are referred to here as minimum wage.\n\nIt is your responsibility to decide whether the person is a worker for minimum wage purposes and, if they are, whether an exemption applies to them.\n\nFailure to pay the minimum wage to someone who is entitled to it is against the law. If an unpaid person claims that they are owed minimum wage arrears, you must prove that they are not a worker or that no arrears are owed. Someone\u2019s entitlement to the minimum wage depends on the contractual relationship with their employer, not their job title.\n\n## What is work experience\n\nThe term \u2018work experience\u2019 generally refers to a specified period of time that a person spends with your business, during which they have an opportunity to learn directly about working life and the working environment.\n\nSome work experience positions offer people the chance to try their hand at particular tasks, others simply provide an opportunity to watch and learn. The nature, length and arrangements for work experience vary greatly. Someone\u2019s entitlement to the minimum wage will depend on whether the work experience offered makes the individual a worker for minimum wage purposes.\n\n## What counts as an internship\n\nWork experience can be called a \u2018placement\u2019 or an \u2018internship\u2019. Internships are sometimes understood to be positions requiring a higher level of qualification than other forms of work experience, and are associated with gaining experience for a professional career. However, the term \u2018intern\u2019 has no legal status under minimum wage law. Entitlement to the minimum wage does not depend on what someone is called, the type of work they do, how the work is described (such as \u2018unpaid\u2019 or \u2018expenses only\u2019) or the profession or sector they work in. What matters is whether the agreement or arrangement they have with you makes them a worker for minimum wage purposes. [See \u2018Who gets the minimum wage\u2019.](https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage/who-gets-the-minimum-wage)\n\nSome forms of work experience, including placements and internships, may be referred to as \u2018unpaid work\u2019 or \u2018expenses only\u2019, where someone gives their services free of charge in order to develop or maintain their skills. Organisations offering such positions should check if the person is a [volunteer](https://www.gov.uk/volunteering) for minimum wage purposes or if an exemption applies. If the person is not a genuine volunteer and is not exempt, then you must pay them at least the minimum wage.\n\n## Exemptions in the legislation relevant to work experience\n\nSome people are not entitled to the minimum wage because there is a specific exemption in the rules.\n\nThe exemptions relevant to work experience are:\n\n  * students working as a required part of a UK-based further or higher education course don\u2019t qualify for the minimum wage if their placement with you or your organisation does not exceed 1 year. The exemption does not apply to students performing work that is not related to their course, such as to help finance their studies or during a gap year\n  * people undertaking work experience for you who are of compulsory school age are not entitled to the minimum wage. If someone is above compulsory school age but has stayed on in full or part-time education, they are entitled to the minimum wage unless they are undertaking a work placement with you as a required part of their studies\n  * participants in government schemes or programmes to provide training, work experience or temporary work, or to help in seeking or obtaining work\n  * participants in EU Lifelong Learning Programmes (Leonardo da Vinci, European Community Youth in Action, Erasmus or Comenius)\n  * voluntary workers in your organisation are exempt from the minimum wage if both the following apply: \n    * you are a charity, voluntary organisation, associated fund-raising body or statutory body\n    * you give them no monetary payments and only limited and specified expenses and benefits\n\n\n\nNot every worker who works for a charity, voluntary organisation, associated fund-raising body or statutory body is automatically a voluntary worker.\n\n## Arrangements which don\u2019t qualify for the minimum wage\n\nSomeone who is doing a placement that does not involve any work being performed, such as work shadowing, will not come within the National Minimum Wage legislation. They are only observing and are not performing work.\n\nPeople who are doing a placement on a volunteer basis are not workers for minimum wage purposes.\n\n## Volunteers\n\nIn general a volunteer is someone who:\n\n  * has an arrangement with you or your organisation which does not entitle them to a financial reward or benefit in kind for work they perform under the arrangement\n  * does not have to turn up for work if they don\u2019t want to (even if you or their colleagues expect them to or they generally work to a regular pattern)\n  * cannot be dismissed, sued for breach of contract or have payment or reward withheld if they fail to do the work or perform the services they were providing\n\n\n\nThe intention behind the unpaid activity (whether to benefit the environment, other groups, or the individual personally) is irrelevant. Someone may volunteer to do work to gain experience or in the hope that they will get a good reference. However, a promise to provide a contract or further work that will be paid may make the individual a worker for minimum wage purposes and thereby entitle them to the minimum wage.\n\nVolunteers may be paid back reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Payment of such expenses will not make them a worker for minimum wage purposes.\n\nCalling an unpaid worker \u2018unpaid\u2019 or \u2018a volunteer\u2019, even if the individual agrees to this, does not prevent them from qualifying for the minimum wage if they are entitled.\n\n## What to consider when designing work experience placements\n\n### Recruitment advertising\n\nBefore advertising a vacancy on an \u2018unpaid\u2019 or \u2018expenses only\u2019 basis, you should check whether the person that you are planning to recruit will be classed as a worker for minimum wage purposes. [See \u2018Who gets the minimum wage\u2019.](https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage/who-gets-the-minimum-wage)\n\nAdverts which suggest illegal unpaid positions inform HM Revenue and Customs\u2019 risk assessment process, and employers who are considered to be \u2018at risk\u2019 of not paying the minimum wage may be targeted for further investigation.\n\n### Employment contracts and other written agreements\n\nIf you take someone on a work shadowing or on a volunteer basis, it is recommended that you agree elements of the arrangement in writing, such as learning objectives, and tailor their activities to these learning objectives. Documenting objectives for the work experience and recording that you will pay back \u2018out of pocket\u2019 expenses will not, in itself, amount to an employment contract or a contract to personally perform work or services which entitles the individual to the minimum wage.\n\nSimply stating in a written agreement that a person is not a worker or that they are a volunteer does not mean that they are so for the purposes of NMW legislation. A court or tribunal would look at the reality of the arrangements made with the individual to decide if they are entitled to the minimum wage.\n\nStating in documents that the minimum wage does not apply will not limit your liability to pay the minimum wage when it is due. National Minimum Wage legislation ensures an employer cannot avoid paying minimum wage in this way (even if the person concerned agrees to this).\n\n### Record keeping and health and safety\n\nIf you take someone on as a worker, the usual rules on record keeping apply.\n\nIf you take someone on a work shadowing or volunteer basis, we strongly recommend that you document the arrangement that you have made with the person, and/or keep a record of any oral agreements in setting up the arrangements and any subsequent changes. In particular, if someone claims that they owed minimum wage arrears, you must demonstrate that they are not a worker for minimum wage purposes or that no arrears are owed.\n\nThe government encourages people who accept work experience placements or internships to keep records of what they agreed with their employer. This information may be used as evidence if their entitlement to the minimum wage is considered at a future date, such as by a tribunal or [HM Revenue and Customs](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs). Note the promise of a contract or future job may amount to a benefit in kind which makes the person a worker for minimum wage purposes.\n\nMaking someone doing work experience comply with a legal requirement, such as health and safety, is unlikely on its own to result in the person being classed as a worker and entitled to the minimum wage.\n\n## Work experience - examples\n\nThese are for illustrative purposes only. Ultimately only a court or tribunal can decide if someone is entitled to the minimum wage in a given set of circumstances.\n\n### Examples of workers who are entitled to the minimum wage\n\n#### Example 1: internship with an oral agreement\n\nLucas takes up an internship at a newspaper business. He agrees orally with the editor that he will work personally for 4 days a week from 9am to 5pm and will undertake research activities as directed. He receives some payment for working the agreed hours.\n\nLucas has made an oral contract with the editor and should be paid at least the minimum wage.\n\nA contract can be oral or implied as well as written.\n\n#### Example 2: \u2018unpaid intern\u2019 with a promise of paid work\n\nAmanda applies for a position at a record company. She is told that for 3 months she will be paid \u2018expenses only\u2019 and is referred to as an \u2018unpaid intern\u2019. However, as part of her agreement with the company, it is promised that at the end of her \u2018internship\u2019 she will be taken \u2018on the books\u2019 and paid above the minimum wage.\n\nAmanda should be paid at least the minimum wage for the whole time she spends at the record company.\n\nWhether someone is a worker does not depend on what job title they are given. For example, calling someone an \u2018unpaid intern\u2019 or \u2018volunteer\u2019 does not prevent them from qualifying for the minimum wage if they are really a worker. The promise of paid work is a form of reward for work undertaken.\n\n#### Example 3: work experience with a financial reward\n\nDavid successfully applies for a work experience position in a small graphic design company, after seeing an advert offering \u00a350 \u2018travel expenses\u2019 for each week. He receives these \u2018travel expenses\u2019 despite walking to work.\n\nDavid should be paid at least the minimum wage.\n\nPaying a financial reward which is more than paying back genuine \u2018out-of-pocket\u2019 expenses is evidence that David is a worker for minimum wage purposes.\n\n#### Example 4: signed agreement to \u2018unpaid\u2019 work with a reward\n\nBen takes up an acting role in a short film. He signs a form agreeing to work unpaid. However he is promised a small percentage of any future profits, a DVD copy of the film and tickets to the company\u2019s releases for the rest of the year, but no salary.\n\nBen should be paid at least the minimum wage.\n\nAn individual cannot sign away their rights to the minimum wage. Entitlement to the minimum wage depends on whether they are a worker. Ben isn\u2019t a volunteer because he will get a reward for the work he does - the fact that no cash changes hands is irrelevant as benefits in kind that have a monetary value count as a reward.\n\n### Examples of workers who are not entitled to the minimum wage\n\nThese workers are covered by a specific exemption in National Minimum Wage legislation.\n\n#### Example 5: work experience of less than a year as part of a course\n\nKaterina is studying at teacher training college to become a primary school teacher. She spends 2 periods of 8 weeks working in local primary schools as part of her course.\n\nKaterina does not need to be paid the minimum wage because the work is a required part of her course and the placement at the primary school does not exceed 1 year.\n\nStudents doing work experience as a required part of a UK-based further or higher education course are workers who are exempt from the minimum wage, as long as the total time of their placement does not exceed 1 year.\n\nHowever, in the evenings, Katerina works in a local restaurant to fund her studies. Katerina should be paid at least the minimum wage for her work in the restaurant. The exemption does not cover students doing work that is not part of their course.\n\n#### Example 6: voluntary worker at a charity with a contract for paid expenses\n\nDonna takes up an internship as a charity\u2019s events organiser. She has a contract in which she has agreed to organise certain events for the charity and attend on particular days and times \u2013 she is not paid, but travel and lunch expenses are paid back.\n\nDonna does not need to be paid the minimum wage because she is a voluntary worker.\n\nVoluntary workers are workers who are specifically exempt from the minimum wage under National Minimum Wage legislation. To be exempt, they must work for a charity, voluntary organisation, associated fund raising body or statutory body and receive no monetary payments and only limited and specified expenses and benefits.\n\n### Examples of individuals who are not workers and are therefore not entitled to the minimum wage\n\n#### Example 7: work shadowing\n\nSayeed, a university student, arranges 2 weeks\u2019 work shadowing at a local company. This is unrelated to his studies. At the company, Sayeed shadows team members in different parts of the organisation and learns about the company. His activities are limited to observing, listening and questioning. He does not receive any payments, but can claim travel expenses.\n\nSayeed does not need to be paid the minimum wage because he is not a worker for minimum wage purposes.\n\nIndividuals taking part in work shadowing are not performing work.\n\n#### Example 8: volunteering with no contract\n\nRyan volunteers at a museum. He has no contract with the museum. He has a regular pattern of working on Tuesdays and Thursdays 9am to 6pm. He is not obliged to turn up for work, but is asked to let the museum\u2019s manager know if he is unable to come on his usual days. He is welcomed back after periods away. His role usually involves administrative tasks (answering the phones and taking notes of meetings in a set format), but can change from day to day, with details set out by a manager each morning. He is unpaid but receives travel and lunch expenses for the days he works.\n\nRyan does not need to be paid the minimum wage as he is a volunteer.\n\nOthers expecting you to turn up or generally working a regular pattern does not necessarily indicate you are a worker, unless the employer can require you to work or impose sanctions for failure to do work. An individual can be a volunteer even if they are working under the supervision or control of a manager or having to meet specific standards or guidelines.\n  *[NMW]: National Minimum Wage\n  *[NLW]: National Living Wage",

      "body": "## Maternity Leave policy and procedure\n\nFebruary 2017\n\nPolicy review date: 28/02/2020\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (the Agency) aims to provide full support to pregnant employees at this important time. The following paragraphs explain the Agency\u2019s arrangements for maternity leave and pay as well as outlining the current statutory rights for you. Where you are eligible under both the statutory and the Agency schemes, you may choose the option which is more beneficial to you. However, if you have entitlement to the Agency provisions as well as statutory rights, you can only exercise one option, not both.\n\nThis policy should be read in line with the Agency\u2019s Shared Parental Leave (SPL) policy if you wish to share your parental leave. Where a woman and her partner meet the qualifying conditions for SPL, the woman can end her maternity leave and pay, or commit to ending it at a future date and share the untaken balance of maternity leave and pay as SPL and pay. Please refer to the SPL policy for further information.\n\n### Scope\n\nThis policy applies to all pregnant agency employees.\n\nThis policy does not apply to contractors or agency workers who should refer to the maternity leave entitlements set out by their employer. Staff on secondment from other organisations will need to refer to their own maternity leave and pay arrangements.\n\n### Notifying the agency\n\nThe Agency has a duty to provide details of maternity leave entitlement to you as soon as you know you are pregnant. Therefore, at least 15 weeks before your expected week of childbirth (EWC), you should notify your line manager and HR in writing of the following:\n\n  * the expected date of childbirth\n\n  * the intended date of leaving work\n\n  * whether or not you intend to return to work\n\n  * confirm in due course, the actual date of childbirth and, if you intend to return to work before the date when your maternity leave will end, give as much notice as possible, and not less than 28 days. If you subsequently change your mind, you must give your manager at least 28 days\u2019 notice of this change.\n\n\n\n\n### Health and safety whilst pregnant\n\nThe agency has a duty to take care of the health and safety of all employees. They are also required to carry out a risk assessment (Appendix A) to assess the workplace risks to women who are pregnant, have recently given birth or are breastfeeding. This is especially important where the work is of a kind that could involve a risk of harm or danger to your health and safety or the health and safety of your baby. If applicable, the agency will provide you with information as to any risks identified in the risk assessment. If the risk assessment reveals that you would be exposed to health hazards in carrying out your normal job duties, the agency will take such steps as are reasonably necessary to avoid those risks, such as altering your working conditions. In exceptional circumstances some cases, this may mean offering you suitable alternative work (if available) on terms and conditions that are not substantially less favourable.\n\nIf all other options have been exhausted and in exceptional circumstances, if it is not possible for the agency to alter your conditions to remove the risks to your health and there is no suitable alternative work available to offer you on a temporary basis, the agency may suspend you from work on maternity grounds until such time as there are no longer any risks to your health. This may be for the remainder of your pregnancy until the commencement of your maternity leave. If you are suspended in these circumstances, your employment will continue during the period of the suspension and it does not in any way affect your statutory or contractual employment and maternity rights. You will continue to be entitled to your normal salary and contractual benefits during the period of your suspension, unless you have unreasonably refused an offer of suitable alternative employment.\n\n### Part one \u2013 Contractual Entitlement\n\n#### 1\\. Paid maternity leave\n\nYou will be allowed 26 weeks maternity leave on full pay and a subsequent 13 weeks paid at Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) (See Statutory Maternity Pay below for further information) for the period of continuous absence before and after childbirth, provided you:\n\n  * State that you intend to return to work in the Agency after your maternity leave, and agree to repay any contractual payment made during that period if you fail to the agency for at least 1 month. You should complete the application form in Appendix B. If you fail to do so, paid maternity leave will not be allowed; and\n\n  * You are in paid service at the time your maternity leave begins and have completed at least 1 years\u2019 service within the Civil Service which needs to be continuous (staff in receipt of sick pay at pension rate are not regarded as being in paid service).\n\n\n\n\nIf ineligible for paid maternity leave, you will still have a statutory right to 52 weeks unpaid leave, and may qualify for SMP or maternity allowance. See also the Special Leave guidance.\n\nThe period of paid maternity leave will not be regarded as sick leave. The payments received will count for pension purposes in the same way as normal salary.\n\n  1. Repayment of paid maternity leave\n\n\n\nThe terms of the relevant undertaking (see Appendix B) require you to return to work within 52 weeks from the start of your maternity leave period or at the end of an agreed career break for at least 1 month. Failing to return for the minimum period will mean that the salary paid must be refunded to the Agency. Exceptionally, a refund may be deferred if your return to work is delayed by certified sickness or by authorised special leave without pay, provided you eventually resume duty and complete the equivalent of a calendar month\u2019s paid service.\n\n### Part two \u2013 Statutory Entitlement\n\n#### 1\\. Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP)\n\nPregnant women employees are entitled to:\n\n  * 26 weeks ordinary maternity leave (OML), followed by a further\n\n  * 26 weeks additional maternity leave (AML) regardless of how long they have worked in the Civil Service.\n\n\n\n\nThe first 39 weeks is normally paid leave, either in the form of Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP), subject to length of service, or Maternity Allowance which is paid by Department of Work and Pensions offices.\n\n#### 2\\. SMP Entitlement\n\nYou will be entitled to SMP if you:-\n\n  * Have been continuously employed in the Civil Service for at least 26 weeks by the 15th week before the expected week of childbirth (the qualifying week) and have been employed at least one day into the qualifying week; and\n\n  * Have average gross earnings of not less than the lower earnings limit for National Insurance contributions applicable in the qualifying week (above average earnings are calculated by adding your gross earnings for the last 8 weeks prior to the qualifying week, multiplying by 6 and dividing by 52); and\n\n  * Are still pregnant at the 11th week before the expected week of childbirth or have given birth by that time; and\n\n  * Have stopped work to have a baby (whether or not you intend to return to work after childbirth); and\n\n  * Inform the Agency in writing (see Appendix B) before your absence begins; and\n\n  * Submit a maternity certificate (form MAT B1) or other statement from a medical practitioner or certified midwife confirming the expected week of childbirth.\n\n\n\n\nSMP is payable for a maximum of 39 weeks. This pay period can start at any time from the 11th week before the expected week of childbirth up to the expected week of childbirth without any loss of SMP. Within this limit, you may choose when your maternity pay period begins.\n\nSMP is not payable if the pregnancy ends other than by a live birth before the 25th week of pregnancy. In these circumstances SSP should be considered. In the event of a still birth after the 24th week of pregnancy you will be entitled to the same amount of\n\nmaternity leave and pay as if the baby was born alive. Please contact your HR Advisor for further information.\n\nThe agency recognises that this will be a difficult and traumatic time and would encourage the use of the confidential assistance programme, Workplace Wellness. Their number is 0800 111 6387\n\nIf you are expecting more than one baby during a pregnancy, you are only entitled to one payment of SMP.\n\n#### 3\\. Amount of SMP payable\n\nSMP is payable for complete weeks only, starting at midnight between a Saturday and Sunday, for a maximum of 39 weeks. It is paid on your normal pay-day and subject to PAYE income tax and National Insurance contributions.\n\nSMP is paid at the rate of 90% of earnings for the first six weeks and, for the remaining 33 weeks, the lesser of (a) the standard flat rate (refer to government website for current figures https://www.gov.uk/maternity-pay-leave/pay) or (b) 90% of normal weekly earnings\n\n#### 4\\. Statutory maternity leave and maternity allowance\n\nWomen not entitled to SMP may be entitled to Maternity Allowance (MA) from the Department of Work and Pensions. The claim for MA should be made on form MA1 (available from any Jobcentre Plus office) and submitted with evidence of pregnancy (MAT B1) on or after the 14th week before the expected week of childbirth.\n\nA deduction equivalent to the standard rate of MA will be made automatically from salary if it appears that entitlement to MA exists. If MA is not payable then you should send the notification form to HR so that payment of salary can be corrected. If you do not claim the full benefit to which you are entitled, the full deduction will nevertheless be made unless HR is satisfied with the explanation given. You may also be entitled to other statutory benefits e.g. Incapacity Benefit or Working Families Tax Credit and should contact Jobcentre Plus for details of entitlement and claims. If SMP is not payable HR will notify you, provide you with form SMP1 and return your maternity certificate (form MAT B1). If you wish to claim Maternity Allowance, you should take both forms to your local Jobcentre Plus office.\n\nIf you disagree with the decision not to pay SMP, you can ask HR to provide a written statement giving reasons. If you still disagree, you can ask the Adjudication Officer at any Jobcentre Plus office to adjudicate.\n\n#### 5\\. Additional maternity leave\n\nYou will be entitled to take 26 weeks additional maternity leave immediately after ordinary maternity leave (OML). The first 13 weeks of additional maternity leave will be paid at SMP rates and the remaining 13 weeks will be unpaid.\n\n### Part three: All employees\n\n#### 1\\. Starting maternity leave\n\nIf you are entitled to paid maternity leave or statutory maternity pay, you may begin your leave at any time from a date which is after the 11th week before the expected week of childbirth. Unpaid maternity leave can, however, start up to 14 weeks before the expected date of childbirth. If it is considered advisable for you to begin leave shortly before your intended date (e.g. on safety grounds) you will be given special leave with pay for the additional absence if it does not qualify as paid sick leave.\n\nIf childbirth occurs prior to the 11th week before the expected week of childbirth, maternity leave will commence from the day after childbirth (childbirth means the birth of a live child or a still birth after 24 weeks of pregnancy). If you have notified your intention to start maternity leave later than the 4th week before the expected week of childbirth and have been continuously on pregnancy related sick leave, the start of the maternity leave will be the start of the continuous absence or the 4th week date, whichever is later.\n\nOnce you have stated when you would wish your maternity leave to start this date would not normally be changed unless you inform the Agency of the new date and give at least 28 days\u2019 notice of this. In response to receiving the application form, HR will write to you confirming the date your maternity leave (paid and unpaid) is due to end. You will be expected to return to work on that date (see Returning to Work, below).\n\n#### 2\\. Unpaid maternity leave\n\nDuring or following pregnancy you will be allowed to take 26 weeks ordinary maternity leave (OML) followed by 26 weeks additional maternity leave (AML). This does not affect your right to Shared Parental Leave and Parental Leave (see also Special Leave and Shared Parental Leave guidance).\n\n#### 3\\. Returning to work\n\nApart from during the two weeks following the birth of the baby, if you are absent from work because of pregnancy or childbirth and entitled to paid maternity leave, you may return to work (provided you have given prior written notice of your intention to return) at any time up to 52 weeks from the start of her maternity period. You will have been notified by HR of the date when your maternity leave (paid and unpaid) is due to end. Should you wish to return before this date, you should give at least 28 days written notice of the day on which you propose to return. You must give this notice by completing a \u201cNotice of Intention to Return to Work following Maternity Leave\u201d; (see Appendix C). The notice should be a meaningful declaration of intent, i.e. your medical condition at that time is such that a return to work is a realistic expectation.\n\nWhere the maternity leave period is due to end, or you provide at least 28 days notification of your intention to return to work on an earlier date, certificated sick absence may be allowed from this date, in accordance with agency managing sickness absence policy. In\n\nthese circumstances, you will not be allowed to bring forward the date of intended return in order to qualify for paid sick absence from an earlier date. If you exercise your right to return to work after ordinary maternity leave (i.e. the first 26 weeks of maternity leave) you are entitled to return to the same job on the same terms and conditions of employment as if you had not been on maternity leave, unless a redundancy situation has arisen. In these circumstances you would be offered a suitable alternative vacancy.\n\nAfter additional maternity leave (i.e. the period up to 52 weeks) you are entitled to return to work to the same job on the same terms and conditions as if you had not been on maternity leave, unless there is some reason why it is not reasonably practicable for you to do so. In this case you will normally be employed in the same general location but not necessarily in the same post as before. In any event, you will be treated for posting and transfer purposes no less favourably than if you had not been on maternity leave.\n\nIf you have not informed the Agency previously and decide not to return to work following your maternity leave, the usual leaver process should be followed and you should confirm your resignation in writing to your line manager. You will need to provide the required notice as set out in your contract.\n\n#### 4\\. Contractual benefits\n\nDuring the period of maternity leave the contract of employment continues and you are entitled to all the benefits (except remuneration in the case of unpaid leave) which would have accrued had you been at work. You will continue to accrue annual leave entitlement during your maternity leave and will also accrue leave for any public or bank holidays and privilege days that occur during that period.\n\nYou may take annual leave before or after, but not during, your maternity absence (whether paid or unpaid).\n\nIf you have opted into a salary sacrifice to purchase vouchers prior to commencing your maternity leave, this will be suspended if you are on SMP or Nil pay.\n\n#### 5\\. Ante-natal care\n\nIf, on medical advice, you make an appointment to receive ante-natal care, you will be given reasonable time off to keep the appointment. Ante-natal care normally covers appointments to see doctors, midwives or health visitors responsible for that care. You may also be allowed time off with pay to attend relaxation or parent craft classes, providing you supply evidence of enrolment and details of future appointments. You should discuss any appointments with your line manager to ensure there is minimal disruption to your work. You may be required to work flexibility to accommodate any appointments and this may include working from home.\n\n#### 6\\. Sick leave during or following pregnancy\n\nIf a pregnancy related illness occurs during or following pregnancy, (i.e. outside the period of childbirth), it will not be used as a trigger point in the absence policy. All sickness absence should be recorded on Oracle as per the normal reporting rules and the reason\n\nrecorded as \u2018pregnancy related\u2019. For advice on what constitutes pregnancy related illness, please contact your HR Advisor.\n\nSelf-certificates and medical certificates, as appropriate, must be submitted for a pregnancy related illness. For illness unrelated to pregnancy, normal Agency sickness absence arrangements apply.\n\nIf you have a miscarriage before the 25th week of pregnancy then normal sick leave provisions will apply.\n\nIf you are unable to return to work at the end of your ordinary or additional maternity leave the usual arrangements for sickness absence apply.\n\nIf you are not entitled to contractual sick pay, you may be entitled to Statutory Sick Pay (SSP), but you will be disqualified from receiving Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) during the 26 weeks starting with either:-\n\na. the beginning of the week you are first entitled to Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP); or\n\nb. the beginning of the week you are first entitled to Maternity Allowance (MA); or\n\nc. the beginning of the sixth week before the expected week of childbirth if you are entitled to SMP or MA and work beyond that date; or\n\nd. the beginning of the sixth week before the expected week of childbirth if you are not entitled to SMP or MA.\n\nThe disqualification will remain in force as long as a period of incapacity for work or linked period of incapacity for work remains in force.\n\n#### 7\\. IVF\n\nAppointments for IVF treatment will not be regarded as antenatal appointments; these will be dealt with as special leave. Absences resulting directly from the process of IVF will be dealt with as sickness absence and consideration will be taken regarding these being counted towards attendance management warning triggers.\n\n#### 8\\. Contact during maternity leave\n\nThe agency reserves the right to maintain reasonable contact with you during your maternity leave. This may be to discuss your plans for return to work, to discuss any special arrangements to be made or training to be given to ease your return to work or to update you on developments at work during your absence.\n\nYou should agree with your line manager prior to commencing maternity leave how you wish to be informed of any new vacancies in your division. You will still have access to Insite whilst you are on maternity leave.\n\n#### 9\\. Keeping in touch (KIT days)\n\nApart from the two weeks following childbirth, during your maternity leave, you may attend\n\nwork or carry out some other activity, e.g. attend a training course. You will be able to take up to 10 KIT days (which need not be consecutive) to enable you to keep in touch with your job or with developments in the workplace. These keeping in touch days are entirely voluntary and may only be worked if both you and your line manager agree to the arrangement.\n\nIf you choose to use the KIT days you will not be able to extend the overall 52-week maternity leave period by the number of days worked. Any part of a day worked will count as one day. You will be paid in full for any day worked, but will not be entitled to receive contractual maternity pay, SMP or MA in addition on that day.\n\n#### 10\\. Expressing milk\n\nThe agency provides a dedicated rest room for new mothers. Employees can use the contemplation room to express milk. The rest room is located on the Ground floor at BPR and in the Night Duty room at NIBSC.\n\n#### 11\\. Performance related pay\n\nIf you are on maternity leave in a standard reporting year (paid or unpaid) you will be entitled to a PRP increase based upon an assessment of your performance during the part of the year when you were at work. If you have been at work for 3 months or more before going on maternity leave you should complete your PRP with your line manager before your maternity leave starts or arrange to do this during a KIT day (see above). If you have worked for less than 3 months during the standard reporting year, you will receive a PRP rating of \u2018Good\u2019. Your pay award will be paid from the date you return to work.\n\n#### 12\\. Protection against discrimination\n\nAll women have the right to protection from detrimental treatment on the grounds of pregnancy. This means, amongst other rights, that you cannot be dismissed because of pregnancy or childbirth or any reason connected with it during your maternity leave. If during maternity leave a redundancy situation occurs and it is impracticable to continue to employ you in the same post, you will be offered suitable alternative employment to a vacancy where possible.\n\n#### 13\\. Right to request flexible working\n\nAll employees may request to work flexibly. Additionally, employees with 26 weeks\u2019 service with the agency have a legal right to make a request once in a 12-month period to work flexibly. Please refer to the Flexible working policy for further information.\n\n#### 14\\. Career breaks\n\nAll employees who have passed their probation period may submit a request to take a career break. Career breaks are an employee benefit, not an employment right and are granted at the discretion of the agency. All requests for career breaks will be considered against current and forecast business needs at the time the request is made. Please refer to the Career break policy for further information.\n\n### Additional documents\n\n[Maternity leave: appendix A - maternity risk assessment template for new or expectant mothers](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5bacf327e5274a3de9f14153/Maternity_leave_-_APPENDIX_A_.pdf) (PDF, 86.3 KB, 7 pages)\n\n[Maternity leave: appendix B - application for maternity leave](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5bacf33be5274a3dfa2a9762/Maternity_leave_-_APPENDIX_B.pdf) (PDF, 102 KB, 3 pages)\n\n[Maternity leave: appendix C - notice of intention to return to work](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5bacf35240f0b62db2c11584/Maternity_leave_-_APPENDIX_C.pdf) (PDF, 114 KB, 3 pages)\n\n## Paternity Leave policy & procedure\n\nJanuary 2018\n\nPolicy review date: 31/05/2018\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (the \u2018Agency\u2019) is committed to supporting staff in their obligations to their family. This Paternity Leave Policy has been designed to ensure that all members of staff are treated fairly and consistently and in line with relevant legislation.\n\nThe purpose of the policy is to set out the Agency\u2019s provision for Paternity Leave for employees who become parents. Paternity Leave is intended to support parents in the early stage of a child\u2019s life. Following the birth or placement of a child, eligible employees can take up to two weeks\u2019 paid paternity leave to care for the child and/or to support the other parent.\n\n### 1\\. Scope\n\nThis policy is applicable to all employees if their partner is having a baby, adopting a child or having a baby through a surrogacy arrangement and meet the eligible criteria below.\n\n### 2\\. Eligibility\n\nPaternity leave is available to employees who wish to take time off to look after the child and they are:\n\n  * the biological father of the child or the spouse or partner of the mother who will give birth\n  * the spouse or partner of the primary adopter*\n  * the intended parent (if you are having a baby through a surrogacy arrangement)*\n  * have or expect to have responsibility for the child\u2019s upbringing; and\n  * have worked continuously for the Agency for 26 weeks ending with the 15th week before the baby is due;\n\n\n\nor\n\n  * in the case of adoption and fostering, you will have worked continuously for 26 weeks by the \u2018matching week\u2019, i.e. at the end of the week in which the adopter/prospective adopter is notified of being matched with the child (UK adoptions), or the date the child enters the UK (overseas adoptions).\n\n\n\n*In the case of couples who are adopting a child or having a child through a surrogacy arrangement, adoption leave and pay are available to only one member of the couple. The other person can take paternity leave.\n\nEmployees with less than the 26 weeks continuous service are not eligible for paternity leave\n\n  1. Entitlement\n\n\n\nEmployees who meet the above eligibility criteria can choose to take either one week or two consecutive weeks of paternity leave. Paternity leave must be taken in a single block and cannot be taken as odd days or as two separate weeks. A week is the same amount of days that you normally work in a week, for example if you only work on Mondays and Tuesdays a week is 2 days.\n\nDuring paternity leave, eligible employees will be paid by the Agency at their normal rate of pay. (This will include an element of Statutory Paternity Pay (SPP) where appropriate, which is effectively enhanced by the Agency to equal full pay).\n\nEmployees can take only one period of leave per pregnancy even if more than one baby is born as the result of the same pregnancy.\n\n### 4\\. Start and end dates of Paternity Leave\n\nPaternity leave can\u2019t start until the birth of the baby; employees may be able to take some annual leave before. Employees will need to take their paternity leave within 56 days and can choose to take their leave on any day of the week:\n\n  * from the date of the child\u2019s birth, placement or arrival in the UK (whether this is earlier or later than expected), or\n  * a chosen number of days or weeks after the date of birth, placement or arrival in the UK (whether this is earlier or later than expected), or\n  * from a chosen date after the expected date of birth or placement\n\n\n\n### 5\\. Notification process\n\nEmployees should discuss their intention to take paternity leave with their line manager as early as possible so that early consideration can be given to covering their work during their absence.\n\nTo qualify for paternity leave employees must formally inform the Agency by completing the Paternity Leave Application Form \u2013 Annex A and submit it alongside any relevant paperwork on Fusion. The form must be submitted:\n\n  * in the case of births, including surrogate births, by the end of the 15th week before the baby is due, or, if this is not possible, as soon as is reasonably practicable\n  * in the case of adoptions or fostering for adoption, within 7 days of the adopter being advised of being matched with the child or, if this is not reasonably practicable, as soon as is reasonably practicable\n\n\n\nEmployees who are eligible, can choose to take either one week or two consecutive weeks\u2019 paid paternity leave (not odd days).\n\n### 6\\. Paternity Pay\n\nTo qualify for paternity pay, employees must:\n\n  * have worked continuously for the Agency for at least 26 weeks by the end of the 15th week before the expected week of childbirth (known as the \u2018qualifying week\u2019)\n  * be employed by the Agency up to the date of birth/matching week\n  * earn at least \u00a3113 a week (before tax)\n  * give the correct notice (as above)\n\n\n\nTax and National Insurance will be deducted as usual from paternity pay.

If you lose your baby\n\nIn the sad circumstances of the pregnancy ending in stillbirth after 24 weeks of pregnancy (defined as stillbirth) or born alive at any point during the pregnancy, an employee will still be entitled to Paternity Leave as outlined above.\n\nEmployees can also obtain support through the Agency\u2019s independent Employee Assistance Programme (EAP), Workplace Wellness. Details can be found on INsite.\n\n### 9\\. Shared Parental Leave\n\nEmployees may be able to get Shared Parental Leave (SPL) and Statutory Shared Parental Pay (ShPP) if they\u2019ve had a baby or adopted a child.\n\nEmployees can start SPL if they\u2019re eligible and they or their partner end their maternity or adoption leave or pay early. The remaining leave will be available as SPL. The remaining pay may be available as ShPP.\n\nEmployees can take SPL in up to 3 separate blocks. They can also share the leave with their partner if they\u2019re also eligible. Parents can choose how much of the SPL each of them will take.\n\n### 10\\.

This approach supports employee motivation and work life balance. It also helps retain talented employees.\n\n### Purpose\n\nShared parental leave (SPL) is a statutory entitlement to flexible parental leave and pay, available to both parents on an equal basis. Legislative provisions to implement SPL are set out in the Children and Families Act 2014 and statutory instruments made under the powers in the Act.\n\nSPL aims to:\n\n  * allow working parents to share the care of their children\n  * enable working fathers to take a more active role in caring for their children\n  * reduce the gender bias that currently impacts on women\u2019s careers.\n\n\n\nWhere a woman and her partner meet the qualifying conditions for SPL, the woman can end her maternity leave and pay, or commit to ending it at a future date and share the untaken balance of maternity leave and pay as SPL and pay. For adoptive parents, the primary adopter will have to bring their adoption leave period to an end before they or their partner are entitled to SPL.\n\n### Scope\n\nThis policy and related procedure apply to all employees who meet the eligibility criteria (length of service and economic activity) for SPL as set out in the Shared Parental Leave Procedure. Each parent will need to qualify for leave and pay in their own right. This policy applies to births where the expected week of childbirth begins on or after 5 April 2015 and to adoptions where a child is matched or placed for adoption on or after 5 April 2015.\n\n### Policy principles\n\nThe following principles and values underpin this policy: * protection \u2013 retained protection for pregnant women and mothers immediately before and after childbirth. * flexibility \u2013 increased flexibility for employers and employees giving a choice on how employment and caring is shared between parents. * simplicity \u2013 straightforward procedures, easy to access and manage. * shared responsibility \u2013 a system more balanced between genders that allows negotiation of leave patterns between employer and working parents.\n\n### Further information\n\nFurther information and advice about SPL is available in the Shared Parental Leave Procedure, the \u2018How to\u2019 guides, Frequently Asked Questions and Glossary.\n\n## Shared Parental Leave procedure\n\n### Introduction\n\n  1. Shared parental leave (SPL) and shared parental pay (ShPP) provide parents with the opportunity to share the care of their child in the first year, whilst balancing their work and retaining their link to the labour market.\n\n  2. SPL is available to both parents, including adopters and their partners, with main caring responsibilities for a child. It is a statutory entitlement in addition to maternity, paternity and adoption leave. SPL allows eligible parents the choice to end the mother\u2019s maternity leave and pay, or the primary adopter\u2019s adoption leave and pay early, and share the untaken balance as SPL and ShPP. The mother or primary adopter must still take their two weeks post birth compulsory maternity leave or first two weeks adoption leave.\n\n  3. This Procedure should be used by employees and line managers for the application and management of SPL within the agency. It supports the Shared Parental Leave Policy and should be used in conjunction with the \u201cHow to guides\u201d. Where necessary, line managers should consult HR for advice.\n\n  4. A flowchart showing the overview of eligibility is at Annex A.\n\n\n\n\n### Definitions\n\n  1. In this document the following terms and definitions apply:\n\n\n  * Mother \u2013 the birth mother of the child\n  * Primary adopter \u2013 the person with whom the adoptive child is expected to be placed and who has primary care for the child\n  * Partner \u2013 this can be a child\u2019s biological father, the mother\u2019s partner, or the primary adopter\u2019s partner who can be their husband/wife, civil partner or partner living in an enduring relationship with them and the child\n  * Parent \u2013 refers to the birth parents of the child and to adoptive parents or intended parents in surrogacy arrangements\n  * Expected week of childbirth (EWC) in relation to a child means the week, beginning on a Sunday, in which the doctor or midwife expects the child to be born.\n\n\n\n### Roles and responsibilities\n\n  1. The individual roles and responsibilities of line managers and employees in the application process are set out in the following guidance:\n\n\n  * How to: apply for shared parental leave \u2013 Advice for employees\n  * How to: consider shared parental leave requests \u2013 Advice for line managers.\n\n\n\n### Eligibility\n\n  1. SPL and ShPP applies to births where the EWC begins on or after 5 April 2015 and to adoptions where a child is matched or placed for adoption on or after 5 April 2015. The EWC on the maternity certificate (form MATB1) will be used to establish eligibility, irrespective of the actual birth date.\n\n  2. To qualify for statutory SPL and ShPP, both parents (mother/primary adopter and her partner) must meet an economic activity test relating to employment and earnings and an individual test relating to duration of service as well as having main caring responsibility for the child:\n\n\n\n  * Stage 1 - the joint or economic activity test\n\n\n\nIn order to qualify, an employed person must have a partner who:\n\na) shares the main responsibility for the care of the child and is either:\n\n  * their husband, wife, civil partner or joint adopter\n\n  * the child\u2019s other parent\n\n  * their partner.\n\n\n\n\nb) declares that they meet the employment and earnings test. This requires them to have worked for any 26 out of the 66 weeks leading up to the EWC or the adoption matching date and earned at least \u00a330 gross a week for any 13 of those 66 weeks.\n\n  * Stage 2 - the individual test\n\n\n\na) to be eligible for SPL, each parent must have at least 26 weeks continuous service with their respective employer by the end of the 15th week, before the EWC or adoption matching date. They must also still be working for the same respective employer when they intend to take the leave.\n\nb) to be eligible for ShPP each parent must have 26 weeks continuous service with their respective employer at the 15th week before the EWC or adoption placement date. Earnings for the eight week period prior to the 15th week before the EWC or adoption placement date must be over the lower earnings limit.\n\n  1. Employees in a surrogacy arrangement, who are eligible and intend to apply for a parental order, and employees adopting through an approved agency and applying for an adoption order, may also be eligible for SPL. They can opt into SPL once they have accessed adoption leave and pay. Information on approved adoption agencies and parental orders is in the Frequently Asked Questions section.\n\n  2. The mother/primary adopter and their partner need to jointly consider whether they meet the qualifying criteria for SPL. This also applies to prospective parents who have a child placed with them under fostering to adopt arrangements.\n\n\n\n\n### Entitlement\n\n  1. Shared parental leave (SPL) and shared parental pay (ShPP) is a joint entitlement.\n\n  2. Before any SPL and ShPP can be taken, maternity/adoption leave and pay must have ended or there must be a commitment to bring the maternity/adoption leave and pay to an end at a later date.\n\n  3. All employed mothers/primary adopters (including intended parents in surrogacy arrangements) are entitled to 52 weeks of statutory maternity/adoption leave regardless of their length of service. Entitlements to different levels of paid leave and how and when to provide notification are set out in the Maternity/Adoption Policy and Procedures. The Maternity Policy and Adoption Policy can be found on the agency intranet.\n\n  4. As long as a mother has taken her two week post birth compulsory maternity leave period, she will be able to bring her maternity leave to an end early and convert the untaken balance of leave into SPL. If eligible, both parents can choose to share the untaken balance of maternity leave as SPL and ShPP.\n\n  5. A primary adopter must take their first two weeks adoption leave before they are able to bring their adoption leave to an end early and convert the untaken balance into SPL. If eligible, both primary and secondary adopters can choose to share the untaken balance of adoption leave as SPL and ShPP.\n\n  6. SPL can be taken by the partner concurrently with the mother/primary adopter on maternity/adoption leave or both parents can be on SPL together. The combined leave taken by the parents must not exceed their joint entitlement.\n\n  7. If circumstances change and the mother/primary adopter and/or their partner no longer have caring responsibility for the child, they must immediately inform their line managers that they are no longer entitled to SPL.\n\n\n\n\n### False declaration\n\n  1. If an employee fraudulently or negligently gives incorrect information, or makes a false statement or declaration about their circumstances, this will be considered a disciplinary offence. Action will be taken in accordance with the agency misconduct procedures (Poor Performance & Misconduct Policy).\n\n\n\n### Pay\n\n  1. The agency will pay ShPP as follows.\n\n\n  * Eligible employees will be entitled to claim ShPP of up to 39 weeks (less any weeks of statutory maternity pay, maternity allowance or statutory adoption pay already claimed) within one year from the birth or placement.\n  * For 26 of those weeks leave, occupational ShPP will be paid at full pay, less any weeks statutory maternity pay, maternity allowance or statutory adoption pay and leave already taken.\n  * The remaining 26 weeks of SPL will be paid at statutory rate for 13 weeks and 13 weeks unpaid. This mirrors the agency\u2019s occupational maternity pay arrangements.\n  * Regardless of whether one or both parents work in the Civil Service, the amount of ShPP entitlement is counted down from when the 39 weeks of statutory maternity pay, maternity allowance or statutory adoption pay starts.\n  * The agency will not pay more than 26 weeks full maternity pay, adoption pay or ShPP in aggregate to an eligible couple within the Civil Service, as this is a joint entitlement.\n  * SPL and ShPP can be taken at any time during the first year following the birth or placement for adoption, so long as the compulsory maternity period, or two weeks adoption leave, has been taken.\n\n\n  1. Payment of occupational ShPP is conditional upon eligible employees:\n\n\n  * being in paid service at the time their SPL begins and having one year\u2019s Civil Service service\n\n  * stating their intention to return to work in the Civil Service after their final period of SPL. Employees are required to give at least 28 days\u2019 notice of their intention to return and to complete at least one further calendar months\u2019 service, in accordance with the Maternity Policy.\n\n  * agreeing to repay any occupational ShPP received (less any statutory ShPP) if they do not return to work in the Civil Service.\n\n\n\n\n### Ante-natal and pre-adoption appointments\n\n  1. Pregnant women are entitled to reasonable paid leave to attend ante-natal appointments (see the Maternity Policy for more information). Fathers, or an expectant mother\u2019s partner, have a right to take paid time off work to accompany a pregnant woman to attend up to two ante-natal appointments This covers the actual time needed to attend the appointments up to a limit of six and half hours per appointment. There is no qualifying length of service required in order to exercise this right. The Maternity Policy, Adoption Policy and Special Leave Policy can be found on the agency intranet.\n\n  2. This statutory right is available to the husband, civil partner, or partner of the pregnant woman, the father or parent of the expected child, or intended parents in surrogacy cases who meet specified conditions relating to Parental Orders under the Human Embryology and Fertilisation Act 2008.\n\n  3. The mother retains the right to decide if her partner, or the intended parents in surrogacy arrangements, can attend these appointments with her.\n\n  4. Employed couples who are adopting are entitled to time off to attend pre-adoption appointments. This includes prospective adopters with whom a child is placed under a \u201cfostering to adopt\u201d arrangement.\n\n\n\n\n### Requesting leave for ante-natal or adoption appointments\n\n  1. A mother\u2019s partner has the right to take time off in order to attend two ante-natal appointments. This covers the actual time needed to attend the appointments up to a limit of six and half hours per appointment. Employees should advise their line manager of the appointment dates and times as early as possible.\n\n  2. The primary adopter is entitled to take paid time off work to attend up to five pre-adoption appointments. The secondary adopter or partner is entitled to take paid time off to attend up to two pre-adoption appointments. This covers the actual time needed to attend the appointments and is limited to six and half hours per appointment.\n\n  3. If requested, adoptive parents will need to provide evidence to their line managers that the local authority has requested their attendance at adoption meetings.\n\n  4. Line managers and employees should discuss whether working from home or flexibly around appointments would help minimise their absence from work. The Flexible Working Policy is available on the agency intranet.\n\n\n\n\n### Notice to end maternity leave\n\n  1. A mother on maternity leave can end her maternity leave either by returning to work or by giving notice that she will end her leave and/or pay on a date following the two week compulsory period (four weeks for factory workers) after the birth of her child. Notice must be given using the SPL and ShPP Form. Where notice to end maternity leave is accompanied with notification by the mother or her partner to take SPL, the notice to end maternity leave is binding.\n\n  2. The maternity leave will end on that date, whether or not the mother returns to work, unless the mother revokes any notice given prior to childbirth, within six weeks following the birth.\n\n  3. Ending or committing to end maternity leave and pay on a specific date determines the number of weeks entitlement to SPL and ShPP. Eligible parents can share the remaining balance of leave as SPL (up to 50 weeks) and ShPP (up to 37 weeks). If the mother returns to work in advance of the date given on the notice, the entitlement to SPL and ShPP will still be based on the original end date.\n\n\n\n\n### Notice to end adoption leave\n\n  1. To end their adoption leave and/or pay, primary adopters on adoption leave must give at least eight weeks\u2019 notice and have taken the first two weeks as statutory adoption leave. This notice must also be at least one week before the last day of the statutory adoption leave period. Notice must be given using the SPL and ShPP Form.\n\n  2. Adoption leave will end on the date notified, whether or not the adopter returns to work.\n\n  3. Ending or committing to end adoption leave on a specific date determines the number of weeks entitlement to SPL and ShPP. Eligible parents can share the remaining untaken balance of leave as SPL (up to 50 weeks) and ShPP (up to 37 weeks). If the primary adopter returns to work in advance of the date given on the notice, the entitlement to SPL and ShPP will still be based on the original end date.\n\n\n\n\n### Revoking a binding notice to end maternity leave\n\n  1. To opt into SPL, a birth mother will have given binding notice to end her maternity leave early without taking her full maternity entitlement.\n\n  2. She can revoke binding notice given prior to childbirth, up to six weeks following childbirth, providing she has not returned to work. This is because returning to work will automatically end her maternity leave.\n\n  3. Her partner must immediately inform their employer of any change to their entitlement to SPL.\n\n  4. If a birth mother has revoked her notice in the six weeks following childbirth, she can still submit binding notice to end maternity leave at a later date, by giving eight weeks notice.\n\n\n\n\n### Providing notification for SPL\n\n  1. For parents to access SPL and ShPP, the mother/primary adopter will first need to give their employer at least eight weeks\u2019 notice of their intention to end maternity/adoption leave. Where notice to end maternity leave is accompanied with notification by the mother or her partner to take SPL, the notice to end maternity leave is binding. The mother\u2019s/primary adopter\u2019s maternity/adoption leave and maternity/adoption pay period will cease on the day specified on the notice.\n\n  2. Notification periods for SPL are the same for the mother/primary adopter and their partner in maternity, adoption, and surrogacy arrangements.\n\n  3. An employee will need to give their line manager a minimum of eight weeks\u2019 notice of intention to take SPL using the SPL and ShPP Form. This includes a non-binding indication of the expected pattern of leave to give an early indication to line managers of the intended leave pattern.\n\n  4. The notice can be submitted at any time, provided that a minimum of eight weeks\u2019 notice is given for each period of leave. Early notification allows employees and line managers to begin discussions about dates and patterns of leave sooner and plan for absences. If the notification is submitted only eight weeks before the first day of the first period of leave this notification will also become the binding notice of SPL (detailed below). More detailed information on notice periods is in the Frequently Asked Questions section and in the \u201cHow to guides.\u201d\n\n  5. Line managers must request the following as evidence to ensure an employee\u2019s entitlement to SPL:\n\n\n\n  * a copy of the child\u2019s birth certificate or, if unavailable, a declaration signed by both parents stating the date and location of birth \u2013 If the request is made before the birth of the child this must be provided within 14 days of the child\u2019s birth. If the request is made after the birth of the child this must be provided within 14 days of the request\n\n\n\nor * a copy of a matching document issued by the adoption agency, notifying that the child is to be placed with the primary adopter \u2013 This must be provided by the employee within 14 days of the request\n\nand * the name and address of their partner\u2019s employer \u2013 This must be provided within 14 days of the request.\n\n### Fostering to adopt\n\n  1. In fostering to adopt arrangements, \u2018looked after children\u2019 are placed with approved foster parents who agree to adopt the child with little or no notice, if the parental rights of the birth parents are terminated.\n\n  2. In these circumstances, employees will be unable to provide the usual notice required prior to their absence on adoption leave. Foster to adopt parents are specially trained in placements that are likely to lead to adoption. Therefore, prospective parents in this situation are encouraged to have early discussions with their line manager to help prepare for absences at short notice.\n\n\n\n\n### SPL pattern requests\n\n  1. SPL allows working parents to take short periods of leave in minimum one week blocks. This enables them to intersperse periods of work with periods of leave and to take leave at the same time if they choose to. Each employed parent agrees their pattern of leave with their line manager.\n\n  2. To confirm their leave requirements, an employee must provide their line manager with binding notice of SPL on the SPL and ShPP Form, signed by them and their partner.\n\n\n\n\nThis must be received a minimum of eight weeks before the employee intends to be absent on SPL. It does not need to include details of all the requested SPL and all discontinuous weeks. Any subsequent leave requests will require an eight week notice period and be subjected to the limit of three notifications. This limit includes the initial request of SPL and any previously notified SPL requests. There can only be three formal notifications for leave or changes to periods of SPL overall.\n\n  1. Line managers will need to check through BMS that their employee meets the qualifying criteria for SPL and ShPP. They should consider the needs of the business before agreeing any periods of discontinuous weeks of SPL in a single notice. At no point will the respective line managers of each parent be expected to contact one another.\n\n  2. During the first two weeks of the eight week notice period, the line manager and employee should discuss and agree sign-off of the leave pattern(s). An employee may withdraw a notice without penalty in these two weeks.\n\n  3. If the employee and line manager cannot reach agreement, the employee is entitled to take their SPL in a single block commencing on a date specified by the employee. This start date can be provided up to five days after the two week discussion period, provided the leave period starts no sooner than eight weeks from the submission of the original notification.\n\n  4. If a line manager fails to respond to an employee\u2019s notice of SPL and requested pattern, the SPL will revert to the default position of a continuous period of leave for the total amount of SPL requested in the pattern. The employee will have five days from the end of the two week discussion period to notify their line manager of when that continuous period will start. This must not be within eight weeks of the original submission of the request, but can be later. If the employee does not specify a start date then the SPL will start on the first date stated in their original request.\n\n\n\n\n### Requests to change SPL patterns\n\n  1. Once an employee has submitted notice of a period of SPL they will only be able to withdraw that request within the two week discussion period at the beginning of the eight weeks notice. To make changes after this point they would need to submit a formal change notification, which would be included in the limit of up to three notifications overall.\n\n  2. If already within a period of agreed leave, this will continue until agreement of a new leave pattern is reached and the required notice period is completed. Notice periods may be waived due to unforeseen circumstances.\n\n  3. Changes which are mutually beneficial to the business and the employee can be made without this counting towards the limit of three notifications.\n\n\n\n\n### Managing SPL\n\n  1. It is important for employees and their line managers to keep in touch during extended periods of absence from the workplace. This enables line managers and employees to be kept updated on changes within the workplace, or personal circumstances, which can ease the employees return to work.\n\n\n\n### SPL in Touch (SPLIT) Days\n\n  1. The right to maternity \u201cKeeping in Touch\u201d (KIT) days remains until maternity leave ends. Once SPL begins, each parent can have up to 20 SPLIT days each to use whilst on SPL. It is anticipated that SPLIT days will be used to enable an employee to return to work for one or more days in the weeks they are absent on SPL for training/keeping up to speed with changes in work, part time working or a phased return to work. Full pay will apply for these days and they may only be used with the agreement of the employer and the employee.\n\n\n\n### Leaving the agency\n\n  1. If an employee leaves the agency and the civil service as a whole during a period of SPL, they are no longer eligible for SPL and ShPP. An employee will need to repay any occupational ShPP paid during their SPL, excluding statutory ShPP.\n\n  2. If an employee transfers to another government department, they remain in civil service employment. As there is no break in continuity of service, their entitlement to SPL and ShPP is unlikely to be affected. However, if an employee has agreed an SPL pattern with their previous department they will need an early discussion of these arrangements with their new line manager to ensure they can be honoured.\n\n  3. If SPL is taken during a loan or secondment period, line managers and employees should refer to agency guidance on loans and secondments. The secondment or loan agreement should be discussed by the contracting parties.\n\n\n\n\n### Right to return\n\n  1. Employees who end their right to maternity or adoption leave will no longer benefit from specific rights associated with maternity or adoption leave. However, similar rights are provided under SPL.\n\n  2. Under SPL, the right to return to the same job is maintained for all employees returning from any period of leave (maternity, paternity, adoption, or SPL) that totals 26 weeks or less in aggregate, even if the leave is taken in discontinuous blocks. Up to four weeks of unpaid parental leave are disregarded for the purpose of the right to return to the same job.\n\n  3. Employees also have the right to return to the same job, or, if it is not reasonably practical for the employer, enter another job which is both suitable and appropriate for them, if:\n\n\n\n  * total SPL taken when added to any other period of relevant statutory leave is more than 26 weeks; or\n  * a period of SPL was consecutive with a period of parental leave of more than four weeks; or\n  * a period of SPL was the last of two or more consecutive periods of relevant statutory leave of more than four weeks.\n\n\n  1. Line managers should follow agency guidance on risk assessments for new and expectant mothers throughout the pregnancy and on the mother\u2019s return from maternity and/or SPL in the six month period following birth. Details of the agency\u2019s pregnancy risk assessments may be found within the Health and Safety section of the intranet.\n\n  2. If an employee would like to return to work using a different working pattern, this is considered in line with the \u2018Flexible Working Policy\u2019 and supporting documents, which may be found on the HR pages of the intranet. When considering an application for a different working pattern, line managers will try to accommodate the request, but there can be no guarantee that it will be agreed.\n\n\n\n\n### Further information\n\n  1. For further information on the SPL application process, see the line manager and employee \u201cHow to guides\u201d and checklists, Frequently Asked Questions and Glossary.\n\n  2. Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) also have guidance on SPL.\n\n  3. Any enquiry about the content of this instruction, or request for advice about the application of the procedures to particular circumstances, should be referred directly to the HR team.\n\n\n\n\n### Additional documents\n\n[Shared Parental Leave policy and procedure: Annex 1 - flowchart to show overview of eligibility](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5bae2715e5274a3e0d7af9c9/MHRA-Shared-Parental-Leave-Policy-Procedure-Annex-1.pdf) (PDF, 210 KB, 2 pages)\n  *[PDF]: Portable Document Format",

      "body": "## Employees who were on furlough under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS)\n\nThese rules apply where the employee\u2019s period of family-related statutory pay begins on or after 25 April 2020.\n\nIf your employee was on furlough and you paid them with help from the scheme during any part of the relevant 8 week period, there are different rules about how you work out their Average Weekly Earnings (AWE).\n\nThis is to make sure your employee\u2019s eligibility for Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) and earnings-related rate of SMP is not affected if their wages were lower than normal because of being on furlough.\n\nThe earnings used to work out their AWE for the part of the 8 week period that they were on furlough will be the higher of either what they:\n\n  * actually received from their employer\n  * would have received from their employer had they not been on furlough\n\n\n\nWhere it\u2019s not clear what the employee would have received, a helpful starting point is the reference salary used to determine how much you claimed through the scheme. You can find guidance on [working out 80% of your employees wages through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/work-out-80-of-your-employees-wages-to-claim-through-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme).\n\nYou should also consider payments the employee was due to receive in the relevant period that would have been classed as earnings. This could include:\n\n  * bonus payments\n  * commission payments\n\n\n\nNo changes to how you work out their AWE will be needed where:\n\n  * you claimed the employee\u2019s wages through the scheme but you topped them up to full pay at your own cost \u2014 the employee\u2019s earnings were not lower than they would have been\n  * as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, during the relevant period you agreed a reduction in pay with your employee outside of the scheme\n\n\n\n## Employee earnings affected by a pay rise\n\nA pay rise must not be withheld because of maternity leave.\n\nYou must recalculate the average weekly earnings (AWE) to take account of pay rises awarded, or that would have been awarded had your employee not been on maternity leave.\n\nThis applies if the pay rise was effective from anytime between the start of the 8 week relevant period for Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) and the end of the statutory maternity leave.\n\nIf a pay rise is awarded after you\u2019ve calculated your employee\u2019s earnings, and that pay rise is effective from the start date of the relevant period but before the end of the statutory maternity leave, you must:\n\n  * recalculate the AWE to include the pay rise as though it was effective from the beginning of the relevant period\n  * pay any extra SMP due\n\n\n\nIf a pay rise is awarded which, when recalculated, means that earnings are now high enough for your employee to get SMP when they could not before, you must:\n\n  1. Work out 90% of the AWE.\n  2. Take away the standard rate of SMP.\n  3. Pay the difference for 6 weeks.\n\n\n\nIf 90% of the AWE is less than the standard rate you might not have to pay your employee anything.\n\nThis is because they may have received the balance of SMP due from Jobcentre Plus (or the Jobs and Benefits office in Northern Ireland) as Maternity Allowance (MA).\n\nNot all women are entitled to MA, or the MA may be less than the SMP your employee is now entitled to. You should ask them to get a letter from the Jobcentre Plus (or the Jobs and Benefits office in Northern Ireland) to confirm how much MA was received.\n\nIf your employee gives you a letter from the Jobcentre Plus office (or the Jobs and Benefits office in Northern Ireland) showing how much MA was received:\n\n  1. Work out the total amount of SMP they\u2019re entitled to.\n  2. Take away the MA that was paid.\n  3. Take away any SMP you\u2019ve already paid.\n  4. Pay your employee the difference.\n\n\n\nYour employee should still benefit from a pay rise, even if they do not intend to return to work with you after their maternity leave has ended.\n\nIf a pay award is made after they have terminated their employment and the pay rise is backdated to when they were working for you, or were on maternity leave with you, they may be entitled to benefit from the pay rise. You must check the terms of their old contract of employment.\n\nIf more than one pay rise has been awarded during the period they were on maternity leave you\u2019ll need to make separate calculations for each one.\n\n## Underpayments and overpayments\n\nIf there are over or underpaid earnings affecting the AWE which disadvantages either you or the employee, check if there\u2019s documentary evidence agreeing to the amount that should have been paid.\n\nIf there is use the agreed earnings to calculate the AWE.\n\nIf there is not use the actual earnings.\n\n## Employee becomes sick\n\nIf the employee:\n\n  * becomes [sick during the SMP pay period](https://www.gov.uk/statutory-sick-pay-employee-circumstances-that-affect-payment#emp-preg) do not pay Statutory Sick Pay (SSP), continue to pay SMP as normal\n  * returns to work within the Maternity Pay Period (MPP) and then goes sick during that period, pay SMP, not SSP\n\n\n\n## \u2018Keeping in touch\u2019 days\n\nTo keep in touch during maternity leave and ease your employee\u2019s return to work, they can work for you during their maternity leave for up to 10 days. This will not end their maternity leave or mean they lose their SMP for any weeks that they do some work.\n\nThese 10 days are called \u2018keeping in touch\u2019 (KIT) days and allow your employee to undertake training or do occasional work for you.\n\nThe employer has no right to demand that KIT work is undertaken and an employee does not have to do it. Before any work is done, you must agree with your employee:\n\n  * what work they\u2019ll be doing\n  * whether the KIT days are used in a row, one at a time or in blocks \u2014 any work on any day (even an hour) will count as a whole KIT day\n  * how much they\u2019ll be paid for the work they do\n\n\n\nYou may count the amount of SMP towards the contractual pay agreed with your employee, but you must pay the weekly SMP rate the employee is entitled to and comply with your statutory obligations (for example, paying at least the National Minimum Wage).\n\nIf your employee works more than 10 days for you in their SMP pay period:\n\n  * you cannot pay SMP to them for any weeks where they work\n  * their maternity leave will come to an end\n\n\n\nOnce your employee has used their 10 KIT days, they\u2019ll lose one week\u2019s SMP for each week or part week they work for you.\n\nThe SMP pay period is not extended to take account of these weeks. Any SMP lost in this way is always at the standard rate first, or 90% of the AWE if this is lower than the standard rate.\n\nAn employee must take 2 weeks \u2014 or 4 weeks if working in a factory \u2014 compulsory maternity leave immediately after the date the child is born, and cannot work or use a KIT day during that time.\n\n## Employee returns to work then goes off sick\n\nWhere your employee has returned to work within their MPP and goes off sick they cannot get SSP from you. You should consider paying SMP.\n\n## Employee leaves job\n\nYour employee cannot get maternity leave if they have left their job, but they may still qualify for SMP.\n\nIt does not matter why they left or that they\u2019re not coming back \u2014 they\u2019re entitled to SMP if they satisfy the qualifying conditions, you cannot ask them to repay it.\n\nThere are special rules for when you start to pay. Work out the date of the Sunday of the 11th week before the week the baby is due.\n\nIf they leave your employment before that date, the SMP pay period will start on the earlier of the following dates:\n\n  * the Sunday of the 11th week before the baby is due\n  * the day after the baby is born\n\n\n\nIf they leave their employment after the start of the 11th week, and before any other event which may trigger their pay, then the pay period starts the day following the day on which they left their employment.\n\n## Employee works for another employer\n\nIt\u2019s up to your employee to tell you that they\u2019re working for another employer and when they stop working for that employer.\n\n### Employee starts work with another employer before or during the qualifying week (QW)\n\nIf your employee started work for another employer before the end of the QW you must continue to pay SMP throughout the MPP, even if they\u2019re still working for that employer after the baby is born, unless one of the following apply:\n\n#### Employee starts work with another employer after the QW and before the baby is born\n\nIf your employee starts work for another employer after the QW, but before the birth of the child you do not have to pay SMP for any weeks they work for that employer after the baby is born.\n\nYou must reinstate SMP for any full maternity weeks your employee does not work for that employer after the baby is born.\n\nIf your employee\u2019s contract with that employer ends during the MPP, their entitlement to SMP will restart until the end of the MPP.\n\n#### Employee starts work for another employer after the baby is born\n\nIf your employee starts work for another employer after the baby is born, you do not have to pay SMP for any weeks they work for that employer.\n\nYou must pay SMP for any full maternity weeks your employee does not work for that employer.\n\nIf your employee\u2019s contract with that employer ends during the MPP, entitlement to SMP also ends and cannot be restarted.\n\nYou must issue your employee with [form SMP1](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statutory-maternity-pay-employee-not-entitled-form-for-employers).\n\n## Employee taken into legal custody\n\nYou cannot pay SMP for any SMP pay week your employee is in legal custody (this usually means they\u2019re in prison) or for any week in the pay period after that.\n\nYou must give the employee [form SMP1](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statutory-maternity-pay-employee-not-entitled-form-for-employers) within 7 days of the decision being made. This must be done within 28 days from the date the employee gave notice of absence (or the date they gave birth if this had occurred earlier).\n\nIt\u2019s your employee\u2019s responsibility to tell you if they\u2019re detained in legal custody.\n\nThey are not in legal custody if they\u2019re:\n\n  * voluntarily helping police with their enquiries\n  * out on bail\n  * serving a suspended sentence\n\n\n\n## Employee dies\n\nIf your employee dies during the MPP, you should pay SMP for the week in which they die, but not for any week in the MPP after that.\n\n## Baby dies\n\nIf the baby dies during the SMP pay period, payment should continue as normal.\n\n## Stillbirth\n\nYour employee is entitled to SMP and maternity leave if the baby is stillborn.\n\nA stillbirth occurs if the baby is stillborn after the 24th week of pregnancy.\n\nYou\u2019ll need evidence before making payment (for example, a stillbirth certificate issued by the registrar, or a certificate or notification for the registration of a stillbirth issued by the attending midwife or doctor).\n\nIf a baby is born alive but survives only for an instant, this is a live birth and you must apply the rules for a live birth.\n\n## Break in employment\n\nSome breaks between periods of employment will not interrupt a period of continuous employment for SMP purposes. Employees with an ongoing contract of service during the following breaks remain continuously employed:\n\n  * temporary cessation of work \u2014 including short-term contract or agency workers\n  * public holidays\n  * sickness or injury \u2014 the employee can get SMP if the total period of incapacity is 26 weeks or less\n  * paternity, parental and adoption leave \u2014 if the employee took paternity leave when they were adopting a child, or when a baby was born and they worked for you before and after the break\n  * pregnancy \u2014 if your employee was not working for you because of a birth, and they worked for you before and after the break, and the break is not more than 26 weeks\n\n\n\n## Non-cash payments and contractual benefits\n\nYou may normally pay some of your employee\u2019s earnings as a non-cash payment (for example, providing board and lodging or giving them goods or services).\n\nHowever, you must pay any SMP in full. SMP cannot be sacrificed or offset against other benefits, it must be paid in cash.\n\nAll non-pay contractual benefits must continue during statutory maternity leave. These may include any childcare vouchers, company car or mobile phone provided to the employee as part of their contract of employment.\n\n## Lump sums\n\nIf you decide to pay the SMP as a lump sum, you and your employee could pay more National Insurance contributions (NICs) than if you paid it on their normal payday.\n\n## Reinstatement after dismissal\n\nIf your employee did not work for you during the relevant period because you dismissed them, they\u2019re entitled to SMP as if they had not been dismissed, if:\n\n  * they\u2019re reinstated because an employment tribunal decides that you dismissed them unfairly\n  * you reinstate them as a result of a statutory grievance procedure\n\n\n\n## Reinstatement after armed forces service\n\nIf the employee did not work for you during the relevant period because they were serving in the armed forces, but they returned to work for you within 6 months of the end of their service in the forces they may still be able to get SMP.\n\nThe employee must have been continuously employed by you for at least 26 weeks by the end of the QW to get SMP.\n\nThe period they served in the armed forces does not count as part of the 26 weeks.\n\nThe period they were employed with you before and after their service in the armed forces will count.\n\n## Trade disputes or industrial action\n\nYour employee must have been continuously employed by you for at least 26 weeks by the end of the QW. Do not count the period they were on strike (even if this was one day) as this week will not count as part of the 26 weeks.\n\nYour employee must have been employed for 26 weeks from the start of their employment into the QW.\n\n## Premature or early birth after QW\n\nIf the baby is born early, there are special rules for when your employee needs to give you evidence and when you start to pay. All the other terms and conditions apply.\n\nYour employee will not have been able to give you advance notice, but they must tell you the date of birth as soon as possible.\n\nYour employee should give you medical evidence (usually a form MATB1 maternity certificate) of the date the baby was due and the date of birth. You can accept a birth certificate as evidence of the date of birth.\n\nYour employee should give you the evidence within 21 days after the date of birth, or as soon as they can if that\u2019s not possible, and no later than 13 weeks after the start of the SMP pay period.\n\nThe maternity leave and SMP pay period starts on the day after the date of birth.\n\n## Baby born in or before the QW\n\nIf the baby is born in or before the QW, there are special rules. The employee must:\n\n  * give you medical evidence of the date the baby is due\n  * have been continuously employed by you for 26 weeks\n  * have AWE high enough in the [relevant period](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/statutory-maternity-pay-manually-calculate-your-employees-payments#terminology-explained)\n  * give you acceptable notice for start of SMP\n\n\n\nYour employee should give you medical evidence (usually a form MATB1 maternity certificate) of the date the baby was expected to be born as well as the actual date of birth.\n\nYou can accept any document signed by a doctor or midwife as long as an expected date of birth is provided.\n\nYou can accept a birth certificate as evidence of the date of birth, but this is not accepted as evidence of the date the baby is due.\n\nYour employee should give you the evidence within 21 days of the start of their SMP pay period, or as soon as they can, but no later than 13 weeks after the start of the SMP pay period.\n\nIf the baby is born before or during the QW, the continuous employment rule is satisfied as if they would have completed 26 weeks continuous employment with you if the baby had not been born early.\n\nYou must work out the AWE in the [relevant period](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/statutory-maternity-pay-manually-calculate-your-employees-payments) by using the birth date instead of the QW.\n\n## Pregnancy-related absence\n\nIf the employee is absent from work because of their pregnancy and the absence continues into or starts within the 4 week period starting on the Sunday of the 4th week before the week baby due, there are special rules for when leave starts and when you start to pay.\n\nThe SMP pay period and their maternity leave start on the day after the first complete day of absence from work because of their pregnancy within the 4 week period. This may mean that you have to pay a mixture of wages and SMP at the beginning or end of the period.\n\nIf you are not sure whether the employee\u2019s absence is caused by their pregnancy contact the [Employer Helpline](https://www.gov.uk/contact/hm-revenue-customs/employer-enquiries) for advice.\n\n## Employee does not qualify for SMP: PAYE Settlement Agreements\n\nYou must recalculate your employee\u2019s AWE if all of the following apply:\n\n  * their AWE are less than the lower earnings limit in force at the end of the QW\n  * they received any expense payments or benefits in kind in the relevant period\n  * the expenses or benefits were included in a [Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Settlement Agreement](https://www.gov.uk/paye-settlement-agreements)\n\n\n\nYou must recalculate their AWE if you had to recalculate your employee\u2019s earnings because they did not qualify and both the following apply:\n\n  * some of their earnings were included in a [PAYE Settlement Agreement](https://www.gov.uk/paye-settlement-agreements)\n  * they get a backdated pay rise that\u2019s effective during or before the start of the relevant period which you had not included in the original calculation\n\n\n\nIf they do not intend to return to work after the birth they may still be entitled to benefit from the pay rise. You must check the terms of their old contract of employment.\n\n## Salary sacrifice\n\nIf an employee has entered into a [salary sacrifice](https://www.gov.uk/salary-sacrifice-and-the-effects-on-paye) their AWE is calculated using the amount of earnings actually paid to them during the relevant period. SMP cannot be sacrificed, it must be paid in full.\n\nTo calculate AWE for SMP, base the calculation on earnings subject to NICs. See [expenses and benefits](https://www.gov.uk/expenses-and-benefits-a-to-z) for more information.\n\nSome schemes for childcare support provided by you and made available to your employees may be exempt from PAYE tax and Class 1 NICs.\n\nThe value of the childcare vouchers provided during the MPP cannot be deducted from the SMP.\n\nWhere an employee agrees to accept [childcare vouchers](https://www.gov.uk/expenses-and-benefits-childcare) as part of a salary sacrifice their SMP entitlement will be assessed on their gross earnings on which NICs are payable.\n\n  1. Work out the total amount they\u2019re now entitled to.\n  2. Take away any SMP you\u2019ve already paid.\n  3. Pay any extra SMP due.\n\n\n\nIf the new AWE are less than the lower earnings limit they cannot get SMP.\n\nIf you have not already done so, give the employee [form SMP1](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statutory-maternity-pay-employee-not-entitled-form-for-employers) within 7 days of the decision being made.\n\nThis must be done within 28 days from the date the employee gave notice of absence (or the date they gave birth if this had occurred earlier).\n\nTake a copy of the form MATB1 maternity certificate, and give the original back to your employee.\n  *[CJRS]: Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme\n  *[AWE]: Average Weekly Earnings\n  *[SMP]: Statutory Maternity Pay\n  *[MA]: Maternity Allowance\n  *[SSP]: Statutory Sick Pay\n  *[MPP]: Maternity Pay Period\n  *[KIT]: Keeping In Touch\n  *[QW]: Qualifying Week\n  *[NICs]: National Insurance contributions\n  *[PAYE]: Pay As You Earn",

      "body": "## Agency workers and casual (or short contract) employees\n\n### Agency workers\n\nYou can treat agency workers as employees for PAYE tax and Class 1 National Insurance contributions. If you have to deduct PAYE tax and Class 1 National Insurance contributions from the agency worker\u2019s earnings, or would do if they were high enough, then you will have to pay them Statutory Paternity Pay (SPP) if they satisfy the qualifying conditions.\n\nThey can still get SPP if you:\n\n  * did not have work to offer them\n  * offer work but the employee was unavailable because of sickness, injury, maternity leave, paternity leave, adoption leave, parental leave or paid holiday\n\n\n\n## Agricultural workers\n\nThe Agricultural Wages Board in England was abolished on 1 October 2013.\n\nFrom this date Agricultural workers in England who are not covered by the terms and conditions of the Agricultural Wages Board will be eligible for Statutory Payments if they meet the appropriate qualifying conditions.\n\n### Casual and short contract employees\n\nA casual employee is usually someone who works for an employer, as and when they are required on a series of short contracts of employment with that person. If you have to deduct PAYE tax and Class 1 National Insurance contributions from the worker\u2019s earnings, then you will have to pay them SPP if they satisfy all the qualifying conditions.\n\n## Supply teachers, seasonal workers or other sporadic employment\n\nGenerally the same rules apply as for agency workers, but if they are:\n\n  * sick throughout the Matching week (MW) (adoption) or Qualifying Week (QW) (birth)\n  * not required to work during those weeks\n\n\n\nthey can be treated as having worked in the MW (adoption) or QW (birth).\n\nThis applies even if they do not resume work before commencing paternity absence.\n\n## Mariners\n\nMariners can get SPP if you have a place of business in the UK and they are on a home-trade ship.\n\n## NHS employees\n\nSome NHS employees, whose contracts are split between Strategic Health Authorities and NHS Trusts as a result of NHS reorganisation, can choose to have all their earnings added together for working out Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) for SPP purposes.\n\n## Employee works abroad\n\nWhere your employee works for you outside the UK:\n\n  * from the latest start date for employment with you\n  * up to and including the Sunday of the QW or MW\n\n\n\nand continues to work for you until the baby is born or the child is placed for adoption they can get SPP if you are liable to pay Class 1 National Insurance contributions on their earnings throughout the period or you would have been liable to pay Class 1 National Insurance contributions had their earnings been high enough.\n\nHowever, if you aren\u2019t liable to pay Class 1 National Insurance contributions, your employee may still be able to get SPP where your employee works for you within the European Economic Area (EEA):\n\n  * from the latest start date for employment with you\n  * up to and including the Sunday of the QW or MW\n\n\n\nand continues to work for you until the baby is born or the child is placed for adoption if they worked for you in the QW or MW and you were liable to pay Class 1 National Insurance contributions on their earnings for that week.\n\nFor SPP your employee must continue working for you until the end of the week before they want their SPP to start.\n\nFor the period after the QW or MW the employment can be in either the UK or EEA.\n\n## Directors\n\n### Companies incorporated after 1 October 2009\n\nThere are new regulations for companies incorporated after 1 October 2009. They provide new Articles of Association for these companies and will:\n\n  * apply by default if other Articles are not adopted\n  * allow its directors to determine a director\u2019s remuneration\n\n\n\nDirectors can decide what and when to pay remuneration. There is no need for a resolution of the companies shareholders at its Annual General Meeting (AGM). In such cases payment of director\u2019s fees will be regarded as earnings for the purpose of entitlement to SPP on the date payment was made.\n\n### Companies incorporated before 1 October 2009\n\nThe previous standard Articles, which apply in default, continue to apply. An ordinary resolution is required to determine director\u2019s remuneration. The method of calculating director\u2019s remuneration by an annual figure (after an ordinary resolution has been passed by shareholders) will apply to these companies. Any payments made in anticipation of the annual vote cannot be taken into account for calculating Average Weekly Earnings (AWE).\n\n#### Paid contractually\n\nIf the director is contractually paid a regular salary - their AWE are calculated like any other employee.\n\n#### Paid by a determination of the directors (not a formal vote)\n\nCalculate the AWE by adding together the monies paid and any other payments of earnings, but use the date monies were paid instead of the date of the shareholders\u2019 resolution at the AGM to determine the total earnings during the relevant period.\n\n#### Paid both contractually and by formal vote\n\nA director who is paid contractually may also be paid a bonus or fees by a formal vote. You must still calculate their AWE like any other employee, but you should only include the monies voted by formal vote if the date of the vote falls in the relevant period.\n\n#### Paid only by a formal vote\n\nIf the director is paid only by a formal vote calculate their AWE in the usual way, substituting the dates of the formal votes in place of the normal paydays. A formal vote usually takes place at the company\u2019s AGM and is agreed in the company minutes.\n\n#### Monies drawn in anticipation of a formal vote\n\nSome directors may regularly draw money from the business in anticipation of a formal vote. Do not include this money when working out the director\u2019s AWE, even if National Insurance contributions were deducted at the time they were paid.\n\n## Your employee has more than one job with you\n\nYour employee could have more than one job with you.\n\nIf you:\n\n  * add all the employee\u2019s earnings together to work out Class 1 National Insurance contributions you would do the same to work out the employee\u2019s AWE and the employee can only get one lot of SPP\n  * work out Class 1 National Insurance contributions separately on the employee\u2019s earnings then you must work out their AWE separately and the employee can get more than one lot of SPP\n\n\n\nIf they can only get one payment of SPP from you they should take the same time off from each job otherwise they will lose some of their SPP because they are working for you. If they are entitled to more than one payment of SPP from you they can choose to take different time off from each job without losing their entitlement to SPP.\n\n## Employee has more than one employer\n\nIf your employee has more than one employer they can get SPP from each employer if they satisfy all the qualifying conditions. They can choose to take different time off from each employer.\n  *[MW]: Matching week\n  *[QW]: Qualifying Week\n  *[AWE]: Average Weekly Earnings\n  *[EEA]: European Economic Area\n  *[AGM]: Annual General Meeting",

      "body": "## Terminology explained\n\n### MATB1 Maternity Certificate\n\nThis is the medical evidence that your employee usually provides as proof of pregnancy. Your employee receives this after the 20th week of pregnancy and it includes the date the baby is due.\n\n### Qualifying week\n\nThe qualifying week is the 15th week (Sunday to Saturday) before the week the baby is due.\n\n## Before you begin\n\nInformation you need to work out your employee\u2019s Statutory Maternity Pay:\n\n  * the date the baby\u2019s due \u2014 from your employee\u2019s MATB1 form\n  * your employee\u2019s intended start date for Statutory Maternity Pay, if they have given you one\n  * your employee\u2019s gross pay and the dates they were paid\n  * confirmation that your employee\u2019s gross earnings are liable to employer\u2019s Class 1 National Insurance contributions or would be but for the employee\u2019s age or level of earnings\n\n\n\n## Work out average weekly earnings\n\nAverage weekly earnings must include all earnings on which Class 1 National Insurance contributions are due, or would be due if they were high enough. Statutory Maternity Pay entitlement depends on your employee\u2019s average weekly earnings in the \u2018relevant period\u2019. The average weekly earnings in the relevant period must not be less than the Lower Earnings Limit for National Insurance contributions which applies at the end of the qualifying week:\n\n  * Lower Earnings Limit for 2024 to 2025 is \u00a3123\n\n\n\nDivide all earnings paid in that relevant period by the number of days, weeks or months in that period.\n\n### The relevant period\n\nThis is usually the 8 week period before the qualifying week.\n\nThe end of the relevant period is the last normal payday on, or before the Saturday of the qualifying week.\n\nFor babies born before or during the qualifying week, the 8 week relevant period is the period between the last normal payday on or before the Saturday of the week before the baby is born, and the day after the last normal payday falling at least 8 weeks before.\n\nThe start of the relevant period is the day after the last normal payday falling at least 8 weeks before the end of the relevant period.\n\n#### Example for an employee who is paid weekly\n\nIf an employee is paid weekly and the baby is due on 23 March 2025:\n\nQualifying week | Payday | Last payday at least 8 weeks before the end of the relevant period | Last payday on or before the Saturday of the qualifying week  \n---|---|---|---  \n1 December 2024 to 6 December 2024 | Friday | 11 October 2024 | 6 December 2024  \n  \nThe relevant period is 12 October 2024 to 6 December 2024.\n\nAdd up all the earnings paid between 12 October 2024 to 6 December 2024 and divide by 8 (the number of weeks in the relevant period).\n\nDo not round the figure up or down to whole pence.\n\n#### Example for an employee who is paid monthly\n\nIf an employee is paid monthly and the baby is due on 23 March 2025:\n\nQualifying week | Payday | Last payday at least 8 weeks before the end of the relevant period | Last payday on or before the Saturday of the qualifying week  \n---|---|---|---  \n1 December 2024 to 6 December 2024 | Last working day of the month | 30 September 2024 | 29 November 2024  \n  \nThe relevant period is 30 October 2024 to 30 November 2024.\n\nAdd up all the earnings paid between 1 October 2024 and 29 November 2024:\n\n  * divide by 2 (number of months in the relevant period)\n  * multiply by 12 (number of months in the year)\n  * divide by 52 (number of weeks in the year)\n\n\n\nDo not round the figure up or down to whole pence.\n\n### Weekly paid employees without a whole number of weeks in the relevant period\n\nThis may happen if you bring forward your employee\u2019s normal payday because of bank holidays at Easter or Christmas. Divide the earnings by the number of weeks wages actually paid, not the number of weeks in the relevant period.\n\n### Employees paid multiples of a week\n\nThis may happen if you pay your employee fortnightly or 4 weekly. Divide the earnings by the number of whole weeks in the relevant period.\n\n### Monthly paid employees without a whole number of months in the relevant period\n\nWork out the number of rounded months as follows:\n\n  * count the number of whole months\n  * count the numbers of odd days\n\n\n\nRound up or down as follows:\n\n  * February \u2014 14 days or less round down, 15 days or more round up\n  * any month except February \u2014 15 days or less round down, 16 days or more round up\n\n\n\nDivide the earnings by this number of rounded months.\n\n### Employees not paid in a regular pay pattern\n\nDivide the earnings by the number of days in the relevant period and multiply by 7.\n\n### Mistimed payments\n\nThis only applies to regular payments of earnings paid other than on their normal date, such as due to a bank holiday.\n\nA mistimed payment:\n\n  * occurs when the date of the actual payment of earnings is made earlier or later than the normal contractual payday, such as an annual holiday\n  * should not be confused with a payroll error, where a mistake is made in the payroll resulting in a shortfall of pay when working out the average weekly earnings\n\n\n\nDivide the total earnings in the relevant period by the number of weeks wages actually paid.\n\n### Overpaid or underpaid earnings during the relevant period\n\nAlways calculate average weekly earnings based on all earnings actually paid to the employee within the relevant period, regardless of any over or underpaid wages in that period. Where over or under payments of wages occur within the relevant period, you must include the overpaid or underpaid amount in the average weekly earnings calculation for deciding if Statutory Maternity Pay is due.\n\n## Work out Statutory Maternity Pay\n\nWhen you have worked out the average weekly earnings, work out how much Statutory Maternity Pay is due and pay it on the same day that you would normally pay wages and for the same period.\n\nStatutory Maternity Pay is a weekly payment. Statutory Maternity Pay pay weeks start with the first day of the Statutory Maternity Pay pay period, so an Statutory Maternity Pay pay period that starts on a Wednesday will have pay weeks within the pay period which runs from Wednesday to Tuesday the following week.\n\nStatutory Maternity Pay is payable:\n\n  * 90% of the employee\u2019s average weekly earnings for the first 6 weeks\n  * \u00a3184.03 or 90% of their average weekly earnings (whichever is lower) for the remaining weeks\n\n\n\n### Statutory Maternity Pay paid part weekly\n\nYou can pay Statutory Maternity Pay in part weeks if it helps to align the payments to your employees normal pay period. Divide the weekly rate by 7 and multiply by the number of days for which Statutory Maternity Pay is due in the week or month. For example, if the pay period covers the end of one month and the beginning of the next (2 days in April and 5 days at the beginning of May) then pay two-sevenths in one month and five-sevenths at the beginning of the next month.\n\n### Contractual benefits and Salary Sacrifice\n\nThe calculation of average weekly earnings for Statutory Maternity Pay is based on earnings which are subject to Class 1 National Insurance contributions. Some contractual benefits, such as [childcare schemes](https://www.gov.uk/expenses-and-benefits-childcare) provided by you, may be exempt from PAYE tax and National Insurance contributions. The value of childcare vouchers provided during the maternity pay period should not be deducted from the Statutory Maternity Pay. Statutory Maternity Pay must be paid in full.\n\n## Recovery of Statutory Maternity Pay\n\nYou may be able to [recover some or all of the Statutory Maternity Pay](https://www.gov.uk/recover-statutory-payments) you pay.\n\n## Help and advice\n\nYou can get advice from HMRC [Employer Helpline](https://www.gov.uk/contact/hm-revenue-customs/employer-enquiries).",

      "body": "## Terminology explained\n\n### Matching date\n\nThe date when the adoption agency told your employee that they had been matched with a child.\n\n### Matching week\n\nThe week (Sunday to Saturday) when the adoption agency told your employee that they had been matched with a child.\n\n### Placed\n\nThis is when the child starts living with your employee permanently with the aim of being formally adopted in the future. The child may have stayed with them before this date.\n\n## Before you begin\n\nInformation you need to calculate your employee\u2019s Statutory Adoption Pay:\n\n  * a copy of the matching certificate \u2014 or in the case of an adoption from abroad, a copy of the Official Notification from the relevant UK authority that they\u2019ve agreed that your employee is suitable to adopt a child from overseas\n  * the date the child\u2019s expected to be placed with your employee or to enter the UK\n  * your employee\u2019s gross pay and the dates they were paid\n  * the date your employee started working for you\n  * confirmation that your employee\u2019s gross earnings are liable to employer\u2019s Class 1 National Insurance contributions\n\n\n\n## Calculate average weekly earnings\n\nAverage weekly earnings must include all earnings on which Class 1 National Insurance contributions are due, or would be due if they were high enough. Statutory Adoption Pay entitlement depends on your employee\u2019s average weekly earnings in a \u2018relevant period\u2019. For the tax year 2024 to 2025 the average weekly earnings must be \u00a3123 or more. Divide all the earnings paid in that relevant period by the number of days, weeks or months in that period.\n\n### The relevant period\n\nThis is usually an 8 week period before the matching week.\n\nThe end of the relevant period is the last normal payday on or before the Saturday of the matching week.\n\nThe start of the relevant period is the day after the last normal payday falling at least 8 weeks before the end of the relevant period.\n\n### Example weekly paid employee\n\nThe matching date is 7 December 2024.\n\nMatching week | Payday | Last payday at least 8 weeks before the end of the relevant period | Last payday on or before the Saturday of the matching week  \n---|---|---|---  \n1 December 2024 to 6 December 2024 | Friday | 11 October 2024 | 6 December 2024  \n  \nThe relevant period is 12 October 2024 to 6 December 2024.\n\nAdd up all the earnings paid during the relevant period and divide by 8 (the number of weeks in the relevant period).\n\nDo not round the figure up or down to whole pence.\n\n### Example monthly paid employee\n\nThe matching date is 7 December 2024.\n\nMatching week | Payday | Last payday at least 8 weeks before the end of the relevant period | Last payday on or before the Saturday of the matching week  \n---|---|---|---  \n1 December 2024 to 6 December 2024 | Last day of month | 30 September 2024 | 29 November 2024  \n  \nThe relevant period is 1 October 2024 to 30 November 2024.\n\nAdd up all the earnings paid between during the relevant period and:\n\n  * divide by 2 (number of months in the relevant period)\n  * multiply by 12 (number of months in the year)\n  * divide by 52 (number of weeks in the year)\n\n\n\nDo not round the figure up or down to whole pence.\n\n### Weekly paid employees without a whole number of weeks in the relevant period\n\nThis may happen when you have to bring your employees normal payday forward because of bank holidays at Easter or Christmas. Divide the earnings by the number of week\u2019s wages actually paid, not the number of weeks in the relevant period.\n\n### Employees paid multiples of a week\n\nThis may happen if your employee is paid fortnightly or 4 weekly. Divide the earnings by the number of whole weeks in the relevant period.\n\n### Monthly paid employees without a whole number of months in the relevant period\n\nWork out the number of rounded months as follows:\n\n  * count the number of whole months\n  * count the numbers of odd days\n\n\n\nRound up or down as follows:\n\n  * February \u2014 14 days or less round down, 15 days or more round up\n  * any month except February \u2014 15 days or less round down, 16 days or more round up\n\n\n\nDivide the earnings by this number of rounded months.\n\n### Employees not paid in a regular pay pattern\n\nDivide the earnings by the number of days in the relevant period and multiply by 7.\n\n### Mistimed payments\n\nThis only applies to regular payments of earnings paid other than on their normal date, for example due to a bank holiday.\n\nA mistimed payment:\n\n  * occurs when the date of the actual payment of earnings is made earlier or later than the normal contractual payday, such as an annual holiday\n  * should not be confused with a payroll error, where a mistake is made in the payroll resulting in a shortfall of pay when working out the average weekly earnings\n\n\n\nDivide the total earnings in the relevant period by the number of weeks wages actually paid.\n\n### Overpayment/underpayment of earnings made during the relevant period\n\nAlways calculate average weekly earnings based on all earnings actually paid to the employee within the relevant period, regardless of any over or underpaid wages in that period. Where an overpayment or underpayment of wages was made within the relevant period, you must include the overpaid or underpaid amount in the average weekly earnings calculation for deciding if Statutory Adoption Pay is due.\n\n### Non-cash payments and contractual benefits\n\nYou may normally pay some of your employee\u2019s earnings as a non-cash payment, for example, providing board and lodging or giving them goods or services. However, you must pay any Statutory Adoption Pay in full. Statutory Adoption Pay cannot be sacrificed or offset against other benefits, it must be paid in cash.\n\nAll non-pay contractual benefits must continue during statutory adoption leave. These may include any childcare vouchers, company car or mobile phone provided to the employee as part of their contract of employment.\n\n## Calculate Statutory Adoption Pay\n\nWhen you have calculated the average weekly earnings, work out how much Statutory Adoption Pay is due and pay it on the same day that you would normally pay wages and for the same period.\n\nStatutory Adoption Pay is a weekly payment and the adoption pay period can start on any day of the week, usually the day after the last day your employee worked before starting their adoption leave. For example, an Statutory Adoption Pay period which starts on a Wednesday will have pay weeks within the pay period which run from Wednesday to the following Tuesday.\n\nStatutory Adoption Pay is usually paid for 39 weeks.\n\nStatutory Adoption Pay is payable at:\n\n  * 90% of the employee\u2019s average weekly earnings for the first 6 weeks\n  * \u00a3184.03 from 7 April 2024 or 90% of their average weekly earnings (whichever is lower) for the remaining weeks\n\n\n\n## Statutory Adoption Pay paid part weekly\n\nStatutory Adoption Pay can be paid as part weeks to help employers align the payments to their employees normal pay period by dividing the weekly rate by 7 and multiplying by the number of days Statutory Adoption Pay is to be paid in the week or month. For example, if the pay period covers the end of one month and the beginning of the next (2 days in April and 5 days at the beginning of May) then pay 2/7ths in one month and 5/7ths at the beginning of the next month.\n\n## Help and advice\n\nYou can get advice from HM Revenue and Customs [Employer Helpline](https://www.gov.uk/contact/hm-revenue-customs/employer-enquiries).",

You will then be paid monthly on the same date, unless your payment date falls on a weekend or Bank Holiday.\n\nYou can apply for an advance payment of your Universal Credit if you are in financial hardship while you wait for your first payment, for example, if you can\u2019t afford to pay your rent or buy food.\n\nYou will need to pay back your advance a bit at a time from your future Universal Credit payments, or by other means if you no longer get Universal Credit, for example, from your wages or other benefit you may be getting.\n\nIf you are already receiving Universal Credit you may also be able to get a Budgeting Advance to help pay for emergency household costs, for example, buying a new cooker or for help getting a job or staying in work.\n\n## How to apply for a Universal Credit advance\n\nYou can apply for a Universal Credit advance:\n\n  * before you get your first payment\n  * if you are already being paid Universal Credit and have told us of a change in your circumstances that means you will be paid more Universal Credit but have not yet been paid the increased amount\n\n\n\nTo apply for a Universal Credit advance you can:\n\n  * speak to your Jobcentre Plus work coach\n  * apply through your online account\n  * call the [Universal Credit helpline](https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/contact-universal-credit)\n\n\n\n### Applying through your online account\n\nChoose the \u2018apply for an advance\u2019 section to apply for an advance online through your account .\n\nYou can only apply for an advance online if you are within your first Universal Credit assessment period and you have had an interview at the jobcentre. If you have passed your first assessment period you will need to apply by calling the helpline.\n\nWhen you apply for an advance online, the amount you can get will be shown on screen.\n\nIf you are part of a couple you will also be asked if your partner agrees to the advance.\n\n### Applying through your work coach or the Universal Credit helpline\n\nIf you apply for an advance by speaking to your work coach or calling the Universal Credit helpline, you (and your partner if you have one) will need to:\n\n  * explain why you need an advance\n  * provide bank account details where the advance should be paid (talk to your work coach if you cannot open an account)\n  * have had your identity checked at a jobcentre\n\n\n\n### When you\u2019ll get a decision\n\nYou\u2019ll get a quick decision on your advance application. You\u2019ll usually be told the outcome on the same day.\n\n## How much you can get\n\nYou may be able to get up to 100% of your estimated Universal Credit payment.\n\nYou will need to repay an advance from future Universal Credit payments or by other means if you no longer get Universal Credit, such as from wages or other benefits you may be getting.\n\n## Cost of repayments\n\nIf you apply for an advance online you will be shown on screen the repayment amounts for different repayment periods.\n\nIf you apply by phone, the Universal Credit helpline adviser assesses whether you can afford to repay the advance. If they agree to the advance, they will tell you over the phone:\n\n  * how much you can have\n  * the monthly repayment amounts\n  * when the first repayment is due\n\n\n\n## How the advance is repaid\n\nDeductions are made from your monthly Universal Credit payment.

You must usually pay back the advance within:\n\n  * 24 months if you apply for the advance on or after 12 April 2021 because you\u2019ve made a new claim for Universal Credit\n  * 12 months if you applied for the advance before 12 April 2021 because you made a new claim for Universal Credit\n  * 6 months if you apply for the advance because of a change of circumstances\n\n\n\nYou can ask for your repayments to be delayed if you cannot afford them. Repayments can be delayed for:\n\n  * 3 months if the advance is for a new claim\n  * 1 month if the advance is for a change of circumstances\n\n\n\nThis is only allowed in exceptional circumstances.\n\n## If you are refused an advance\n\nYou might be refused an advance if you:\n\n  * have not had your identity checked at the Jobcentre\n  * have enough money to last until your payment of Universal Credit\n  * live with parents, relatives or friends\n  * have any final earnings or redundancy payments\n  * have any accessible savings\n\n\n\nYou can ask for the decision to be reconsidered but you do not have a right to appeal.\n\n## If you no longer get Universal Credit and have not paid back your advance\n\nYou will need to continue to pay back your advance, even if you stop getting Universal Credit.\n\nIf you move from Universal Credit to another benefit the deductions will usually continue from your payments until the advance is paid off.\n\nIf you move off benefits you will receive a letter telling you how much you owe. The letter will ask you to contact DWP Debt Management Contact Centre to arrange your repayments. It is important that you do not ignore this letter.\n\nIf you don\u2019t make payment arrangements, the DWP can recover the amount you owe by either:\n\n  * contacting your employer (where you have one) to arrange for deductions to be made from your earnings\n  * asking an independent debt collection agency to collect this money on our behalf (you should deal directly with the independent debt collector to arrange repayment)\n\n\n\n## If you no longer get Universal Credit and cannot pay back your advance\n\nYou can contact the DWP Debt Management contact centre if you can\u2019t afford to pay back the amount you owe.\n\nThey can help you come to an affordable arrangement to pay back your advance as well as providing:\n\n  * support with setting up monthly repayments by Direct Debit\n  * paying-in slips for cheque or cash payments\n\n\n\n**DWP Debt Management contact centre**  \nTelephone: 0800 916 0647  \n[Relay UK](https://www.relayuk.bt.com) \u2013 if you cannot hear or speak on the phone: 18001 then 0800 916 0647  \nTextphone: 0800 916 0651  \nCalling from abroad: +44 (0)161 904 1233  \nMonday to Friday, 8am to 7.30pm  \n[Find out about call charges](https://www.gov.uk/call-charges)\n\nBritish Sign Language (BSL) [video relay service](https://connect.interpreterslive.co.uk/vrs?ilc=DWP) if you\u2019re on a computer - find out how to [use the service on mobile or tablet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oELNMfAvDxw)  \nMonday to Friday, 9am to 5pm\n\n## Get an advance in an emergency\n\nYou might be able to get a Budgeting Advance to help with:\n\n  * emergency household costs such as replacing a broken cooker\n  * getting a job or staying in work\n  * funeral costs\n\n\n\nA Budgeting Advance is a loan, and you\u2019ll need to repay it through your regular Universal Credit payments \u2013 your payments will be lower until you pay it back.

      "body": "## Terminology explained\n\n### Matching date (MD)\n\nThe date when the adoption agency told your employee that they had been matched with a child.\n\n### Matching week (MW)\n\nThe week (Sunday to Saturday) when the adoption agency told your employee that they had been matched with a child.\n\n### Week baby due\n\nThe week in which the expected date of the baby\u2019s birth falls, starting with the preceding Sunday and ending on the following Saturday. If the birth falls on a Sunday, that date is the first day in the week baby due.\n\n### Qualifying week (QW)\n\nThe QW is the 15th week (Sunday to Saturday) before the week baby due.\n\n## Before you begin\n\nYou need the following information to calculate your employee\u2019s Statutory Paternity Pay (SPP):\n\n  * for SPP \u2014 the declaration of family commitment signed by your employee \u2014 form SC3, SC4, SC5 or your own version\n  * the date your employee intends to stop work\n  * your employee\u2019s gross pay and the dates they were paid\n  * the date your employee started working for you\n  * confirmation that your employee\u2019s gross earnings are liable to employer\u2019s Class 1 National Insurance contributions (NICs) or would be but for their age or level of earnings\n\n\n\n## Calculate Average Weekly Earnings (AWE)\n\nAWE must include all earnings on which Class 1 NICs:\n\n  * are due\n  * would be due if the earnings were high enough\n\n\n\nSPP entitlement depends on your employee\u2019s AWE in a \u2018relevant period\u2019. For the tax year 2024 to 2025 the AWE must be \u00a3123 or more. Divide all the earnings paid in the relevant period by the number of days, weeks or months in that period.\n\n### The relevant period (births)\n\nThis is usually the 8-week period before the QW.\n\nThe end of the relevant period is the last normal payday on, or before, the Saturday of the QW. If the baby is born before or during the QW, the relevant period will end on the date the baby is born. \n\nThe start of the relevant period is the day after the last normal payday falling at least 8 weeks before the end of the relevant period.\n\n### Example weekly paid employee\n\nBaby due on 24 March 2025:\n\nQW | Payday | Last payday at least 8 weeks before the end of the relevant period | Last payday on or before the Saturday of the QW  \n---|---|---|---  \n8 December 2024 to 14 December 2024 | Friday | 18 October 2024 | 13 December 2024  \n  \nThe relevant period is 19 October 2024 to 13 December 2024.\n\nAdd up all the earnings paid between 19 October 2024 and 13 December 2024 and divide by 8 (the number of weeks in the relevant period).\n\nDo not round the figure up or down to whole pence.\n\n### Example monthly paid employee\n\nBaby due on 24 March 2025:\n\nQW | Payday | Last payday at least 8 weeks before the end of the relevant period | Last payday on or before the Saturday of the QW  \n---|---|---|---  \n8 December 2024 to 14 December 2024 | Last working day of the month | 30 September 2024 | 29 November 2024  \n  \nThe relevant period is 1 October 2024 to 29 November 2024.\n\nYou need to:\n\n  1. Add up all the earnings paid between 1 October 2024 and 29 November 2024.\n  2. Divide by 2 (the number of months in the relevant period).\n  3. Multiply by 12 (number of months in the year).\n  4. Divide by 52 (number of weeks in the year).\n\n\n\nDo not round the figure up or down to whole pence.\n\n### The relevant period (adoption)\n\nThis is usually the 8 week period before the MW.\n\nThe end of the relevant period is the last normal payday on or before the Saturday of the MW.\n\nThe start of the relevant period is the day after the last normal payday falling at least 8 weeks before the end of the relevant period.\n\n### Example \u2014 weekly paid employee (adoption)\n\nMatching date is 5 December 2024:\n\nMW | Payday | Last payday at least 8 weeks before the end of the relevant period | Last payday on or before the Saturday of the MW  \n---|---|---|---  \n1 December 2024 to 6 December 2024 | Friday | 11 October 2024 | 6 December 2024  \n  \nThe relevant period is 12 October 2024 to 6 December 2024.\n\nAdd up all the earnings paid during the relevant period and divide by 8 (the number of weeks in the relevant period).\n\nDo not round the figure up or down to whole pence.\n\n### Example \u2014 monthly paid employee (adoption)\n\nMatching date is 7 December 2024:\n\nMW | Payday | Last payday at least 8 weeks before the end of the relevant period | Last payday on or before the Saturday of the MW  \n---|---|---|---  \n3 December 2023 to 9 December 2023 | Last day of month | 30 September 2024 | 29 November 2024  \n  \nThe relevant period is 1 October 2024 to 29 November 2024.\n\nYou need to:\n\n  1. Add up all the earnings paid in the relevant period.\n  2. Divide by 2 (the number of months in the relevant period).\n  3. Multiply by 12 (number of months in the year).\n  4. Divide by 52 (number of weeks in the year).\n\n\n\nDo not round the figure up or down to whole pence.\n\n### Weekly paid employees without a whole number of weeks in the relevant period\n\nThis may happen if you bring forward your employee\u2019s normal payday because of bank holidays, for example at Easter or Christmas. Divide the earnings by the number of weeks wages were actually paid, not the number of weeks in the relevant period.\n\n### Employees paid multiples of a week\n\nThis may happen if you pay your employee fortnightly or 4 weekly. Divide the earnings by the number of whole weeks in the relevant period.\n\n### Monthly paid employees without a whole number of months in the relevant period\n\nWork out the number of rounded months as follows:\n\n  * count the number of whole months\n  * count the numbers of odd days\n\n\n\nRound up or down as follows:\n\n  * February \u2014 14 days or less round down, 15 days or more round up\n  * any month except February \u2014 15 days or less round down, 16 days or more round up\n\n\n\nDivide the earnings by this number of rounded months.\n\n### Employees not paid in a regular pay pattern\n\nDivide the earnings by the number of days in the relevant period and multiply by 7.\n\n### Mistimed payments\n\nThis only applies to regular payments of earnings paid other than on their normal date, for example due to a bank holiday.\n\nA mistimed payment:\n\n  * occurs when the date of the actual payment of earnings is earlier or later than the normal contractual payday, such as an annual holiday\n  * should not be confused with a payroll error, where a mistake is made in the payroll resulting in a shortfall of pay, when working out the AWE in the relevant period\n\n\n\nDivide the total earnings in the relevant period by the number of weeks wages were actually paid.\n\n### Overpayment or underpayment of earnings made during the relevant period\n\nAlways calculate AWE on all earnings actually paid within the relevant period. Where over or under payments of wages occur within the relevant period, include the overpaid or underpaid amount in the AWE calculation to decide if SPP is due.\n\n### Salary sacrifice\n\nIf an employee has entered into a [salary sacrifice](https://www.gov.uk/salary-sacrifice-and-the-effects-on-paye) with you their AWE is calculated using the amount of earnings actually paid to them after the sacrifice during the relevant period.\n\n### Contractual benefits\n\nThe calculation of AWE for SSP is based only on earnings which are subject to Class 1 NICs. Do not include the value of any benefits which are exempt from class 1 NICs (such as some [childcare vouchers](https://www.gov.uk/expenses-and-benefits-childcare) in your calculation.\n\n### Earnings in the relevant period affected by a backdated pay rise\n\nIf your employee receives a backdated pay rise which increases the amount of earnings already paid in the relevant period and was either:\n\n  * not entitled to SPP\n  * entitled to SPP at less than the standard rate\n\n\n\nYou must recalculate their AWE to check if they are:\n\n  * now entitled, and pay any SPP due\n  * entitled to an increase and pay any extra SPP due\n\n\n\n## Calculate SPP\n\nSPP is a weekly payment. It lasts for 1 or 2 complete weeks and the 2 weeks must be consecutive.\n\nYou must pay your employee the lower weekly rate of:\n\n  * \u00a3184.03 from 7 April 2024\n  * 90% of their AWE\n\n\n\nThe SPP period starts the day after the last day your employee worked before starting their paternity leave.\n\nSPP weeks start with the first day of the pay period. For example an SPP period which starts on a Wednesday will have pay weeks within the pay period which run from Wednesday to the following Tuesday.\n\n###  SPP paid part-weekly\n\nYou can pay SSP as part weeks to help you align your payments to your employee\u2019s normal pay period.\n\nYou can split the weekly rate into 2 parts. If you do this, you will make the calculation on the basis of dividing the weekly rate by 7.\n\nFor example, the pay period for a monthly paid employee covers 2 days in April and 5 days in May. Their employer should pay them two-sevenths in April and five-sevenths in May.\n\n## Help and advice\n\nYou can get advice from HMRC [Employer Helpline](https://www.gov.uk/contact/hm-revenue-customs/employer-enquiries).\n  *[MD]: Matching date\n  *[MW]: Matching week\n  *[QW]: Qualifying week\n  *[SPP]: Statutory Paternity Pay\n  *[NICs]: National Insurance contributions\n  *[AWE]: Average Weekly Earnings",

      "body": "## Overview\n\nIf you\u2019re unemployed or work less than 16 hours a week on average you may be able to get New Style Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA).\n\nNew Style JSA is a fortnightly payment that can be claimed on its own or at the same time as [Universal Credit](https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit).\n\nNew Style JSA is a contribution based benefit. Normally, this means you may be able to get it if you\u2019ve paid enough National Insurance (NI) contributions, usually in the 2 full tax years before the year you\u2019re claiming in. [National Insurance credits](https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-credits) can also count.\n\nIf you qualify, you can get New Style JSA for up to 182 days. After this your work coach will talk to you about your options.\n\nIf you qualify for both New Style JSA and Universal Credit, any New Style JSA you receive will be taken into account as income for Universal Credit.\n\n## Why should I claim New Style JSA?\n\nYour savings and capital (or your partner\u2019s savings, capital and income) are not taken into account when claiming New Style JSA. However, your earnings and any payment you\u2019re getting from a pension can affect the amount you may receive.\n\nWhile you receive New Style JSA you\u2019ll be awarded Class 1 National Insurance credits, which can help towards your State Pension and other contributory benefits in the future. It is a regular fortnightly payment.\n\nThe following table shows what you may be able to claim depending on your circumstances:\n\nYour situation | New Style JSA | Universal Credit  \n---|---|---  \nYou\u2019re unemployed or work less than 16 hours a week on average and you need support between jobs.  \n  \nYou\u2019ve paid and/or been credited with Class 1 NI contributions in the last 2 to 3 years as an employee. | You can apply for New Style JSA \u2013 even if your partner works or you and your partner have savings over \u00a316,000. | You can apply for Universal Credit if you (and your partner) have children or housing costs.  \n  \nYou can also apply for Universal Credit if you (and your partner) have \u00a316,000 or less in savings between you.  \n  \nYour partner\u2019s income will be taken into account as you\u2019ll need to claim Universal Credit as a couple.  \n  \nAny New Style JSA you receive will also be taken into account as income but you may still get Universal Credit.  \nYou\u2019re unemployed or work less than 16 hours a week on average. You need support between jobs and you\u2019ve not paid or have not been credited with Class 1 NI contributions, usually in the last 2 to 3 years. | You\u2019re unlikely to get New Style JSA if you\u2019ve not paid or have not been credited with NI contributions. | You can apply for Universal Credit if you (and your partner) have children or housing costs.  \n  \nYou can also apply for Universal Credit if you (and your partner) have \u00a316,000 or less in savings between you.  \n  \nYour partner\u2019s income will be taken into account as you\u2019ll need to apply for Universal Credit as a couple.  \nYou\u2019re unemployed or work less than 16 hours a week on average.  \n  \nYou\u2019ve paid and/or been credited with Class 1 NI contributions, usually in the last 2 to 3 years as an employee.  \n  \nBetween you, you and your partner have more than \u00a316,000 in savings. | You can apply for New Style JSA.  \n  \nNew Style JSA is not affected by you and your partner\u2019s savings. | You\u2019re unlikely to get Universal Credit because your savings are too high.  \nYou\u2019re unemployed or work less than 16 hours a week on average.  \n  \nYou\u2019ve paid and/or been credited with Class 1 NI contributions, usually in the last 2 to 3 years as an employee.  \n  \nYour partner works.  \n  \nBetween you, you and your partner have less than \u00a316,000 in savings. | You can apply for New Style JSA, as your partner\u2019s work does not affect your entitlement. | You can also apply for Universal Credit as you and your partner have less than \u00a316,000 in savings.  \n  \nYour partner\u2019s income will be taken into account as you\u2019ll need to apply for Universal Credit as a couple.  \n  \nAny New Style JSA you receive will also be taken into account as income but you may still get Universal Credit.  \nYou\u2019re unemployed or work less than 16 hours a week on average.  \n  \nYou receive pension income from previous employment.  \n  \nYou\u2019ve paid and/or been credited with Class 1 NI contributions, usually in the last 2 to 3 years as an employee. | You can apply for New Style JSA.  \n  \nYour pension income may be taken into account. | If you and your partner have less than \u00a316,000 of savings you might also get Universal Credit.  \n  \nYour pension income will be taken into account.  \n  \nAny New Style JSA you receive will also be taken into account as income, but you may still get Universal Credit.  \nYou\u2019re unemployed or work less than 16 hours a week on average.  \n  \nYou have children.  \n  \nYou\u2019ve paid and/or been credited with Class 1 NI contributions, usually in the last 2 to 3 years as an employee. | You can apply for New Style JSA as you\u2019ve paid/been credited with NI contributions so you may qualify.  \n  \nNew Style JSA does not include additional amounts for children. | You can also apply for Universal Credit, as it is a household assessment and you can receive an amount for children.  \nYou\u2019re unemployed or work less than 16 hours a week on average.  \n  \nYou live in rented accommodation, or have a mortgage or home loan, and need help to pay the cost.  \n  \nYou\u2019ve paid and/or been credited with Class 1 NI contributions, usually in the last 2 to 3 years as an employee. | You can apply for New Style JSA as you\u2019ve paid/been credited with NI contributions so may qualify.  \n  \nNew Style JSA does not include an additional amount for housing costs. | You can also apply for Universal Credit, as it is a household assessment and you can receive an amount for your [housing costs](https://www.gov.uk/housing-and-universal-credit).  \n  \n## Eligibility\n\nTo get New Style JSA you usually need to have been working within the last 2 to 3 years as an employee, and have paid (or been credited with) Class 1 [National Insurance contributions](https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance).\n\nYou\u2019ll need to be either unemployed or work less than 16 hours a week on average.\n\nYou\u2019ll also need to take reasonable steps to look for work.\n\nIf you have an illness or disability which stops you from working you cannot get New Style JSA, but you may be able to get [\u2018New Style\u2019 Employment and Support Allowance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/new-style-employment-and-support-allowance).\n\n## How to claim\n\nTo apply, you\u2019ll need your:\n\n  * [National Insurance number](https://www.gov.uk/lost-national-insurance-number)\n  * bank or building society account details (or those of a family member or trusted friend)\n  * employment details for the past 6 months, including employer contact details and dates you worked with them\n  * [private pension](https://www.gov.uk/pension-types) statement letter\n\n\n\n### Apply

mobile number or email address in your online application, you\u2019ll get a text or email to confirm it\u2019s been submitted.\n\nThe Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will then contact you within 14 days of applying. You\u2019ll either:\n\n  * be invited to an interview at your local Jobcentre Plus office\n  * receive a letter to explain why you\u2019re not eligible for JSA\n\n\n\nYou do not need to contact DWP unless it has been more than 14 days since you applied and you haven\u2019t heard anything.\n\n## Your JSA interview\n\nIf you\u2019re invited to an interview, you must attend. It will be at your local Jobcentre Plus office.\n\nYou\u2019ll be asked some questions to confirm your identity and then you\u2019ll make an agreement about what steps you\u2019ll take to look for work.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to bring all of the following:\n\n  * one photographic proof of identity\n  * one proof of address\n  * one further proof of identity\n\n\n\nIf you have a [P45 from your employer](https://www.gov.uk/paye-forms-p45-p60-p11d), bring this to your interview.

This is called a \u2018Claimant Commitment\u2019.\n\nYou and your work coach will agree what goes in your Claimant Commitment. This could include:\n\n  * what you need to do to look for work - for example registering with recruitment agencies, writing a CV\n  * how many hours you need to spend looking for work each week\n\n\n\nWhat you agree to do will depend on things like:\n\n  * your health\n  * your responsibilities at home\n  * how much help you need to get work or increase your income\n\n\n\n[Your JSA might be reduced or stopped](https://www.gov.uk/jobseekers-allowance/your-jsa-claim) if you do not do what you\u2019ve agreed to in your Claimant Commitment and you cannot give a good reason.\n\n## If you disagree with a decision\n\nYou can [challenge a decision](https://www.gov.uk/mandatory-reconsideration) about your claim. This is called asking for mandatory reconsideration.\n  *[JSA]: Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance\n  *[NI]: National Insurance\n  *[DWP]: Department for Work and Pensions",

      "body": "Universal Credit can take money off your payment if you have a debt. You will see this on your Universal Credit statement.\n\nTo find your statement, sign into your online account and go to \u2018Payments\u2019. On your statement, look for \u2018What we take off \u2013 deductions\u2019.\n\n## Who to contact about money taken off your payment\n\nThis depends on what the deduction is for. [Find out who to contact](https://secure.dwp.gov.uk/find-out-who-to-contact-about-money-taken-off-your-universal-credit-payment/).\n\n## Types of debt\n\n### Advance payments\n\nThis is your repayment of a Universal Credit [advance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/universal-credit-advances).\n\n### Universal Credit overpayment\n\nThis is when you have been paid too much Universal Credit. To find out more about your overpayment, sign into your online Universal Credit account. Go to your journal and look for a message about overpayments.\n\nIf you believe you have been overpaid but have not heard from Universal Credit, you need to contact Universal Credit to tell them about this.\n\n### Tax credits and benefit overpayment\n\nThis is when you have been paid too much for any benefit other than Universal Credit. It includes tax credits and Housing Benefit overpayments.\n\nPenalties can be added to a benefit overpayment.\n\nIf you have been overpaid, you will have a journal message or letter explaining what the overpayment is for.\n\nIf you believe you have been overpaid but have not heard from DWP, you must [report it immediately](https://www.gov.uk/benefit-overpayments). If not, you may be prosecuted or have to pay a penalty.\n\n### Recoverable hardship payment\n\nYou can apply for a hardship payment if your Universal Credit payment has been reduced because of a fraud penalty or sanction.\n\nYou will need to pay this back once your fraud penalty or sanction has ended. When the amount you pay back has been agreed it cannot be changed.\n\n### Budgeting and crisis loan repayment\n\nThis is your repayment of a [budgeting or crisis loan](https://www.gov.uk/budgeting-help-benefits). How much you pay back is agreed at the time you accept the loan.\n\n### Other debts you owe \u2013 \u2018third party deductions\u2019\n\nThird party deductions are when money is taken off your Universal Credit to pay your debts for things including:\n\n  * utilities, like electricity, gas and water\n  * Council Tax\n  * child maintenance\n  * rent\n  * service charges\n  * court fines\n\n\n\nOnly 3 third party deductions can be taken at any one time.\n\nUniversal Credit will send you a message in your online journal when a third party deduction starts.\n\n## How much will be taken off your Universal Credit payment\n\nUniversal Credit calculate the amount taken from your payment at the end of every assessment period (one calendar month).\n\nThe amount taken off may change if your:\n\n  * earnings change\n  * other benefits change\n\n\n\nIt is not possible to tell you how much will be taken before this calculation takes place.\n\nNormally the most that can be taken from your payment to repay a debt is 25% of your [Universal Credit Standard Allowance](https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/what-youll-get). This is the basic amount you are entitled to, before money for things like childcare and housing costs are added.\n\nYou may have more than 25% of your Standard Allowance taken off if you pay a \u2018last resort deduction\u2019. A \u2018last resort deduction\u2019 helps to prevent you from being evicted or having your utilities cut off. It is paid directly to the person or organisation you owe money to.\n\n## What to do if you\u2019re struggling to repay your debt\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling, you can ask for a financial hardship decision to reduce the amount of benefit debt you pay.\n\nYou may be considered for this if you have money taken from your Universal Credit for:\n\n  * benefit debt\n  * Budgeting Loan and Crisis Loan repayment\n  * advances\n  * rent arrears (if they\u2019re taken at a rate greater than 10% of the standard allowance)\n\n\n\nIf a decision is made to reduce the amount you pay, it will be applied automatically to your next Universal Credit assessment period.\n\nFind out [who to contact about money taken off your Universal Credit payment](https://secure.dwp.gov.uk/find-out-who-to-contact-about-money-taken-off-your-universal-credit-payment/).\n\n## Advice on money and debt\n\nYou can [get help and advice](https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/other-financial-support) from the government, local councils and other organisations.\n  *[DWP]: Department for Work and Pensions",

      "body": "## Employee earnings affected by a backdated pay rise\n\nIf your employee gets a backdated pay rise which increases the amount of earnings already paid in the relevant period, you must:\n\n  * recalculate the employee\u2019s average weekly earnings\n  * pay the extra Statutory Paternity Pay (SPP) due\n\n\n\nIf your employee was not entitled to SPP, you must recalculate their average weekly earnings to check if they may now be entitled and pay any SPP due.\n\n## Employee does not qualify for SPP: PAYE Settlement Agreements\n\nYou must recalculate your employee\u2019s average weekly earnings if all of the following apply:\n\n  * their average weekly earnings are less than the Lower Earnings Limit in force at the end of the qualifying or matching week\n  * they received any expense payments or benefits in kind in the relevant period\n  * the expenses or benefits were included in a PAYE Settlement Agreement\n\n\n\n## Salary sacrifice\n\nIf an employee has entered into a salary sacrifice with you, their average weekly earnings is calculated using the amount of earnings actually paid to them during the relevant period. SPP cannot be sacrificed and must be paid in full.\n\n## Foster carers\n\nStatutory Paternity Pay (SPP) may be available to foster carers who go on to adopt a child only if they satisfy the qualifying conditions.\n\n## Stillbirth\n\nYour employee is entitled to SPP if the baby is stillborn. A stillbirth occurs if the baby is stillborn from the 24th week of pregnancy. The rules are the same as for a live birth.\n\n## Premature or early birth\n\nIf the baby is born early there are special rules for when your employee has to give you evidence and when you start to pay. Your employee will not have been able to give you advance notice, but they must tell you the date of birth as soon as possible.\n\nThey must still tell you when they want to take their paternity leave and SPP, and whether they want to take 1 or 2 consecutive weeks. They can choose to take their leave any time between the actual date of birth and the end of an 8-week period running from the Sunday of the week the baby was originally due.\n\nIf the baby was born before the employee was due to give you their completed [form SC3](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ordinary-statutory-paternity-pay-and-leave-becoming-a-birth-parent-sc3), they should complete this form and give it to you as soon as possible, confirming the date the baby was due and the date of the actual birth. The form also includes a section for declaration of family commitment. This evidence should be accepted as being on time for the earlier start of SPP.\n\nIf they\u2019d already chosen the start date for their SPP but now need to change this to an earlier date, you should accept that they have given notice on time. You do not need a birth certificate or evidence of pregnancy.\n\nThe SPP period always starts the day after the last day your employee worked before starting their paternity leave. Your employee must tell you when they want to stop work.\n\n## Child dies\n\nEmployees still qualify for Paternity Pay and leave if the baby is either:\n\n  * stillborn from 24 weeks of pregnancy\n  * born alive at any point in the pregnancy but later dies\n\n\n\nEmployees are able to take any paternity leave booked prior to the death of the child. Any leave that has not been already booked can be booked and taken within 8 weeks of the child\u2019s death. \n\nParents may also be eligible for [Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay](https://www.gov.uk/parental-bereavement-pay-leave).\n\n## Child stops living with the adopter\n\nPayments will be affected if the child stops living with the adopter or is returned after being placed for adoption during the first year following birth or placement.\n\nEmployees are able to have any Paternity Pay or leave that was booked prior to the child no longer living with the adopter. Any leave which has not been booked by that point must be booked and taken within 8 weeks of the child no longer living with the adopter.\n\n## Child is not placed or placed later\n\nYour employee cannot be paid until the child is placed. They must tell you when the child is placed so you know when to start paying them. Do not start paying on the assumption that the child was placed on the expected date.\n\n## More than one child is placed\n\nMore than one child may be placed with the adopter under different arrangements. This can happen where 2 or more siblings are adopted from the same family. There is no entitlement to 2 separate periods of SPP and paternity leave if more than one child is placed under the same arrangement.\n\nThe employee will only be entitled to a further period of SPP and paternity leave where each child has been placed under separate adoption arrangements. If a separate matching certificate is issued this would be considered as a separate arrangement.\n\nIf there are separate arrangements, entitlement of up to a further 2 weeks of SPP and paternity leave will commence from the date the second child is placed with the adopter.\n\n## Employee dies\n\nIf your employee dies during the SPP period, you should pay SPP for the week in which they die, but not for any week in the pay period after that.\n\n## Employee leaves job before paternity leave is taken\n\nIf your employee has left their job, they cannot get paternity leave. If they left:\n\n  * before the date the baby was born, they are not entitled to SPP\n  * after the date the baby was born, they may be entitled to SPP\n\n\n\nIf your employee left after the date of birth, it does not matter why they left or that they\u2019re not coming back \u2014 they\u2019re entitled to SPP as long as they do not start work for a new employer during the SPP period.\n\nIf the employment ends after the baby has been born but before the planned start of the SPP period, you may treat the SPP period as beginning on the day after the last day of employment.\n\nYour employee must tell you whether they want 1 or 2 weeks\u2019 pay. However, your employee may choose when to begin their SPP period between the actual date of birth and the end of an 8-week period running from either:\n\n  * the day after the baby is born\n  * the day after the Sunday of the week the baby was originally due\n\n\n\n## Employee leaves job after being matched with a child\n\nIf your employee leaves their job:\n\n  * before the child is placed, they cannot get SPP or paternity leave\n  * after the child is placed but before the planned start of the SPP period, you may treat the SPP period as beginning on the day after the last day of employment or your employee can choose when to begin their SPP period \u2014 between the date the child is placed and the end of an 8-week period running from that date\n\n\n\nYour employee should still give you 28 days\u2019 notice of when they want you to start paying them.\n\n## Reinstatement after dismissal\n\nIf you dismissed your employee and they are then reinstated, they may be entitled to paternity leave.\n\nIf they did not work for you during the period starting 26 weeks before the qualifying week or matching week and ending when the baby was born or child was placed, they are entitled to paternity leave if either:\n\n  * they are then reinstated because an employment tribunal decides that you dismissed them unfairly\n  * you reinstate them as a result of a statutory grievance procedure\n\n\n\nAll the other conditions to entitlement must be satisfied.\n\n## Reinstatement after armed forces service\n\nIf your employee did not work for you during the continuous employment period because they were serving in the armed forces, and they return to work for you within 6 months of the end of their service, they may still be able to get SPP under the Reserve Forces (Safeguard of Employment) Regulations.\n\nFor SPP they must have both:\n\n  * been continuously employed by you for 26 weeks up to and including the qualifying week or matching week\n  * continued to work for you until the baby was born or the child was placed\n\n\n\nDo not count the period they served in the armed forces as part of this period.\n\nA week, in this instance, means Sunday to Saturday. Count part weeks as full weeks.\n\n## Break in employment\n\nFor SPP, your employee must have been continuously employed by you for at least 26 weeks up to and including the qualifying week or matching week. They must continue to work for you right up until the baby is born or until the child is placed.\n\nIf your employee with an ongoing contract of service has a break in employment for any of the following reasons, you should still treat them as continuously employed:\n\n  * temporary cessation of work \u2014 including short-term contract or agency workers\n  * public holidays \u2014 the employee can still get SPP\n  * sickness or injury \u2014 the employee can get SPP if the total period of incapacity is 26 weeks or less\n  * maternity leave \u2014 if the employee works for you before and after the break they can get SPP\n  * adoption leave \u2014 if the employee was on adoption leave and they worked for you before and after the break, they can get SPP\n  * paternity and parental leave \u2014 if the employee took paternity leave or parental leave and they worked for you before and after the break they can get SPP\n\n\n\n## Trade disputes or industrial action\n\nFor SPP your employee must have been continuously employed by you for at least 26 weeks into their qualifying week or matching week. They must continue to work for you until the baby is born or the child is placed.\n\nYou should not include weeks or part weeks where the employee is absent due to a trade dispute or industrial action as part of the 26 weeks, however, such weeks or part weeks do not break the continuity of employment.\n\n## Non-cash payments\n\nYou may normally pay some of your employee\u2019s earnings as a non-cash payment, for example providing board and lodgings or giving them goods or services. The value of the benefit provided during the SPP period may not be deducted from the SPP. You must pay any SPP in full.\n\n## Employee goes abroad\n\nIf your employee leaves the UK during the SPP period, for example to go on holiday or visit relatives living abroad, you are still liable to pay SPP during their absence.\n\n## Employee is not returning to work\n\nIf your employee is not returning to work, you must still pay them SPP. You cannot ask them to repay it.\n\n## Employee becomes sick\n\nIf your employee tells you that they\u2018re sick during the SPP period you must check whether they\u2019re entitled to Statutory Sick Pay or not. You cannot pay them SPP for any SPP week in which they are entitled to be paid Statutory Sick Pay.\n\nYou must give them [form SPP1](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statutory-paternity-pay-non-payment-explanation-spp1) \u2014 non-payment of Statutory Paternity Pay (SPP).\n\nTake a copy of the declaration made by your employee on one of the following forms and give them the original back (if your employee used the online form, they will need to download or print the form after completing it):\n\n  * [form SC3](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ordinary-statutory-paternity-pay-and-leave-becoming-a-birth-parent-sc3) \u2014 becoming a parent\n  * [online form](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/fill-online/apply-for-statutory-paternity-pay) (this replaces from SC4) \u2014 becoming an adoptive parent\n  * [online form](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/fill-online/apply-for-statutory-paternity-pay) (this replaces form SC5) \u2014 ordinary Statutory Paternity Pay and Leave when adopting from abroad\n\n\n\nBear in mind that:\n\n  * SPP weeks can start on any day of the week\n  * your employee will not normally be entitled to be paid Statutory Sick Pay from the first day they are incapable of work\n\n\n\n## Employee works for another employer\n\nNew arrangements will apply to parents of babies with an expected date of birth after 6 April 2024, or an expected adoption placement on or after 6 April 2024. For parents of babies expected to be born or placed for adoption before these dates existing arrangements apply.\n\nIf your employee works for another employer during a week for which they are claiming Statutory Paternity Pay, you need to check whether they were employed by that employer during the qualifying week or matching week. If they were not, it\u2019s up to your employee to tell you that they\u2019re working for that employer.\n\nIf your employee is working for someone who employed them in the qualifying week or matching week, you should continue to pay them SPP as normal.\n\nIf your employee works for someone who did not employ them in the qualifying week or matching week, you must not pay them for the weeks they worked for this second employer. Instead, you must give them [form SPP1](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statutory-paternity-pay-non-payment-explanation-spp1) \u2014 non-payment of Statutory Paternity Pay.\n\nThe employee will still retain their right to claim a second week of Paternity Pay in future if they have not yet claimed their full entitlement. \n\nTake a copy of the declaration made by your employee on either of the following forms and send the original back (if your employee used the online form, they will need to download or print the form after completing it):\n\n  * [form SC3](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ordinary-statutory-paternity-pay-and-leave-becoming-a-birth-parent-sc3) \u2014 becoming a parent\n  * [online form](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/fill-online/apply-for-statutory-paternity-pay) (this replaces from SC4) \u2014 becoming an adoptive parent\n\n\n\nThe employee will still retain their right to claim future Paternity Pay and leave if they have not yet claimed their full entitlement.\n\n## Employee taken into legal custody\n\nNew arrangements will apply to parents of babies with an expected date of birth after 6 April 2024, or an adoption placement on or after 6 April 2024. For parents of babies expected to be born or placed for adoption before these dates, existing arrangements apply.\n\nEmployees taken into police custody while claiming Paternity Pay, who are released without charge or custodial sentence, will have their Paternity Pay entitlement reinstated for:\n\n  * that week held in custody\n  * any subsequent week not yet taken \n\n\n\nEmployees who receive a custodial sentence will not lose their right to claim a second week of Paternity Pay in the future. For further details, read [form SPP1](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statutory-paternity-pay-non-payment-explanation-spp1).\n\nTake a copy of the declaration made by your employee on one of these forms and give them the original back (if your employee used the online form, they will need to download or print the form after completing it):\n\n  * [form SC3](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ordinary-statutory-paternity-pay-and-leave-becoming-a-birth-parent-sc3) \u2014 becoming a birth parent \n  * [online form](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/fill-online/apply-for-statutory-paternity-pay) (this replaces from SC4) \u2014 becoming an adoptive parent \n  * [online form](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/fill-online/apply-for-statutory-paternity-pay) (this replaces form SC5) \u2014 ordinary Statutory Paternity Pay and Leave when adopting from abroad \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s your employee\u2019s responsibility to tell you if they are taken into legal custody. Your employee is in legal custody if they are detained. Usually this means they are arrested or in prison.\n\nThey are not in legal custody if they are:\n\n  * voluntarily helping police with their enquiries\n  * out on bail\n  * serving a suspended sentence\n\n\n  *[SPP]: Statutory Paternity Pay\n  *[PAYE]: Pay As You Earn",

      "body": "## Overview\n\nIf you are ill or have a health condition or disability that limits your ability to work you may be able to get New Style Employment and Support Allowance (ESA).\n\nNew Style ESA is a fortnightly payment that can be claimed on its own or at the same time as Universal Credit (UC).\n\nNew Style ESA is a contributory benefit. Normally, this means you may be able to get it if you\u2019ve paid or been credited with enough National Insurance contributions in the 2 full tax years before the year you\u2019re claiming in.\n\nThis guidance is also available in an [easy read format](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/easy-read-new-style-employment-and-support-allowance).\n\n## Eligibility\n\nTo get New Style ESA you\u2019ll need to have been an employee or self-employed and paid (or been credited with) [National Insurance contributions](https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance), usually in the last 2 to 3 years.\n\nYou can get New Style ESA on its own or at the same time as Universal Credit.

Attend the appointment with your work coach\n\nAttend your \u2018new claim appointment\u2019 and agree with your work coach what actions you\u2019ll need to take to get payments. This is called a \u2018Claimant Commitment\u2019. The appointment will normally be over the phone.\n\nIf a medical professional has said you might have less than 12 months to live, you will not need to attend an appointment or make a Claimant Commitment. Find out more about [getting benefits if you might have less than 12 months to live](https://www.gov.uk/terminal-illness-benefits).\n\n### 3\\. Notification and first payment\n\nYou\u2019ll get a letter from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) telling you if you\u2019ll get New Style ESA and how much.\n\nFurther information on how much New Style ESA to expect\n\n### 4\\. Provide updates about your health and circumstances\n\nTo keep getting New Style ESA you must send fit notes regularly and report any change in your circumstances.\n\nFind out how to [send DWP a fit note](https://www.gov.uk/send-fit-note?step-by-step-nav=a661e652-204c-4abf-a2ce-9f183aca85b9)\n\nFurther information on reporting a change in your circumstances\n\n### 5\\. Complete and return the ESA50 form\n\nYou will be sent form ESA50 in the post, usually within 4 weeks of your first payment. The ESA50 form is a capability for work questionnaire and is your chance to tell DWP how your health condition, disability or illness affects your ability to work.\n\nYou must send the form back within 28 days of the date you receive it from DWP.\n\nFurther [information and advice on completing the ESA50 form](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/sick-or-disabled-people-and-carers/employment-and-support-allowance/help-with-your-esa-claim/fill-in-form/)\n\nIf you\u2019re also claiming Universal Credit the form will be called UC50, you\u2019ll only have one form to complete.\n\n### 6\\. Your Work Capability Assessment\n\nAfter you return your ESA50 form you may be asked to go to an assessment, called a \u2018Work Capability Assessment\u2019. You will be contacted to arrange a date and time for the assessment.\n\nThe Work Capability Assessment is used to find out how much your health condition, disability or illness affects your ability to work. It assesses what you can do, as well as what you cannot do.\n\nYou\u2019ll be asked questions about how your condition affects you in your day to day life. It gives you the opportunity to explain if, and how, your health condition or disability may vary over time.\n\nAssessments can be in person, by video call or on the phone. You\u2019ll be told how your assessment will take place.\n\nYou\u2019ll stay on the \u2018assessment rate\u2019 until a decision can be made on your Work Capability Assessment.\n\nMore information on [Work Capability Assessments](https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance/your-esa-claim).\n\nIf you\u2019re claiming both New Style ESA and Universal Credit you\u2019ll only have to attend one Work Capability Assessment.\n\n### 7\\. Decision letter\n\nYou\u2019ll get a letter with a decision on whether you have limited capability for work or limited capability for work and work-related activity, and if you will continue to receive New Style ESA. It will also tell you if you\u2019ll need to be assessed again at some point in the future.\n\nIf you do need to be assessed again in the future, you\u2019ll be sent another ESA50 form at the appropriate time. This normally happens within 3 years.\n\nIf you disagree with the decision you can ask for the decision to be looked at again - this is called a [mandatory reconsideration](https://www.gov.uk/mandatory-reconsideration?step-by-step-nav=a661e652-204c-4abf-a2ce-9f183aca85b9).\n\nIf you\u2019re claiming both New Style ESA and Universal Credit you\u2019ll get 2 decision letters. If you fail to return form UC50 or fail to attend the Work Capability Assessment you won\u2019t be entitled to both New Style ESA and Universal Credit.\n\n## After your claim is assessed\n\nIf you\u2019re entitled to ESA you\u2019ll be placed in one of 2 groups:\n\n  * a work-related activity group (you cannot work now, but can prepare to work in the future, for example by writing a CV)\n  * a support group (you cannot work now and you\u2019re not expected to prepare for work in the future)\n\n\n\nYou will:\n\n  * usually be in the support group if your illness or disability severely limits what you can do\n  * be in the support group if a medical professional has said you might have less than 12 months to live\n\n\n\n### If you\u2019re in the work-related activity group\n\nYou must attend regular interviews with a work coach. They can help you improve your skills or write a CV to help you get back into work.\n\n### If you\u2019re in the support group\n\nYou\u2019re usually in this group if your illness or disability severely limits what you can do. You do not have to go to interviews. You can tell your work coach if you\u2019d like to take part in work-related activities.\n\n## How much New Style ESA to expect\n\n### Assessment phase\n\nThe first 13 weeks of your claim is called the \u2018assessment phase\u2019 and you are paid the basic allowance.\n\nHow much you\u2019ll get depends on your age:\n\n  * aged 18 to 24 years \u2013 up to \u00a371.70 (per week)\n  * aged 25 years and over \u2013 up to \u00a390.50 (per week)\n\n\n\n### Main phase\n\nIf you have been found to have limited capability for work, you will move onto the \u2018main phase\u2019 for New Style ESA and you will get the basic allowance, plus a \u2018support component\u2019 if you are put in the support group.\n\n  * basic allowance (standard rate) \u2013 up to \u00a390.50 (per week)\n  * support component \u2013 \u00a347.70 (per week)\n\n\n\n### Payment\n\nNew Style ESA is paid at the end of every 2 weeks into your bank, building society or credit union account.\n\n## Pension income\n\nIf you get an occupational or personal pension that pays more than \u00a385 a week, your New Style ESA payment will be reduced by half of the amount over the \u00a385 limit.\n\n## Reporting a change of circumstances\n\nYou need to report changes to your circumstances so you keep getting the right amount of New Style ESA (and Universal Credit if you are claiming both).\n\nYour claim might be stopped or reduced if you do not report a change straight away.\n\nA change of circumstance can include:\n\n  * any changes to your health condition or disability\n  * going into hospital or a care home or sheltered accommodation\n  * starting or stopping work, education, training or an apprenticeship\n  * moving house\n  * changing your name\n  * changes to your pension\n  * changing your doctor\n  * going abroad for any length of time\n\n\n\nCall the New Style ESA helpline if you\u2019re not sure whether you need to report a change.\n\n### How to report changes of circumstances\n\nYou can report a change of circumstances by:\n\n  * calling the New Style ESA helpline\n  * writing to the Jobcentre Plus office that pays your New Style ESA \u2013 the address is on the letters you get about your New Style ESA\n\n\n\n### New Style ESA helpline\n\nTelephone: 0800 169 0310  \nTextphone: 0800 169 0314  \n[Relay UK](https://www.relayuk.bt.com) \u2013 if you cannot hear or speak on the phone: 18001 then 0800 169 0310  \nWelsh language: 0800 328 1744  \nMonday to Friday, 8am to 5pm  \n\n\n[Find out about call charges](https://www.gov.uk/call-charges)\n\nIf you\u2019re claiming Universal Credit as well as New Style ESA, you must report changes to both services.\n\n### Universal Credit helpline\n\nTelephone: 0800 328 5644  \nTextphone: 0800 328 1344  \n[Relay UK](https://www.relayuk.bt.com) \u2013 if you cannot hear or speak on the phone: 18001 then 0800 328 5644  \nWelsh language: 0800 328 1744  \nMonday to Friday, 8am to 6pm  \n\n\n[Find out about call charges](https://www.gov.uk/call-charges)\n\n### British Sign Language (BSL) video relay service\n\nBritish Sign Language (BSL) [video relay service](https://portal.starleaf.com/webrtc?name=DWP&target=DWP@interpreterslive.call.sl) if you\u2019re on a computer - find out how to [use the service on mobile or tablet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZJc6OKmAUA).\n\nThe video relay service is available Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm.\n\nIf you\u2019re in Northern Ireland [contact the NI Direct Employment and Support Allowance Centre](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/contacts/employment-and-support-allowance-centre).\n\n## If you get a sanction\n\nYour ESA can be reduced if you do not attend interviews or do work-related activity as agreed with your work coach in your \u2018Claimant Commitment\u2019.

      "body": "## Overview\n\nIf you are ill or have a health condition or disability that limits your ability to work you may be able to get New Style Employment and Support Allowance (ESA).\n\nNew Style ESA is a fortnightly payment that can be claimed on its own or at the same time as Universal Credit (UC). If you get both benefits, your Universal Credit payment is reduced by the amount you get for New Style ESA.\n\nNew Style ESA is a contributory benefit. Normally, this means you may be able to get it if you\u2019ve paid or been credited with enough National Insurance contributions in the 2 full tax years before the year you\u2019re claiming in.\n\nThis guidance is also available in an [easy read format](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/easy-read-new-style-employment-and-support-allowance).\n\n## Why should you claim New Style Employment and Support Allowance?\n\nYour (or your partner\u2019s) savings will not affect how much New Style ESA you\u2019re paid. If your partner works, it does not affect your claim.\n\nMost income is not taken into account (but a personal pension can affect the amount you may receive).\n\nWhile you receive New Style ESA you\u2019ll earn Class 1 National Insurance credits, which can help towards your State Pension and other contributory benefits in the future.\n\nIt is a regular fortnightly payment.\n\nThis table shows what you may be able to claim depending on your circumstances.\n\nYour situation | New Style ESA | Universal Credit  \n---|---|---  \nYou\u2019ve lost your job and you\u2019re too sick to work. You need help with living costs e.g. rent.  \n  \nYou\u2019ve paid and/or been credited with NI contributions in the last 2 to 3 years (employed or self\u2013employed). | You can claim New Style ESA \u2013 even if your partner works or you and your partner have savings over \u00a316,000 | You can also claim UC if you (and your partner) have \u00a316,000 or less in savings between you.  \n  \nYour partner\u2019s income will be taken into account as you will need to claim UC as a couple.  \n  \nUC is a household assessment and you can receive an amount for children and housing costs.  \n  \nAny New Style ESA you receive will also be taken into account as income but you may still get UC.  \nYou\u2019ve lost your job and you\u2019re too sick to work.  \n  \nYou have not paid any NI contributions in the last 2 to 3 years | You are unlikely to get New Style ESA if you have not paid NI contributions. | You can claim UC if you (and your partner) have \u00a316,000 or less in savings between you.  \n  \nYour partner\u2019s income will be taken into account as you will need to claim UC as a couple.  \n  \nUC is a household assessment and you can receive an amount for children and housing costs.  \nYou\u2019re ill and unable to work.  \n  \nYou\u2019ve paid and/or been credited with NI contributions in the last 2 to 3 years (employed or self\u2013employed).  \n  \nBetween you, you and your partner have more than \u00a316,000 in savings. | You can claim New Style ESA even if your partner works or you and your partner have savings over \u00a316,000. | You are unlikely to get UC because your savings are too high.  \nYou\u2019re ill and unable to work.  \n  \nYou\u2019ve paid and/or been credited with NI contributions in the last 2 to 3 years (employed or self\u2013employed).  \n  \nYour partner works.  \n  \nBetween you, you and your partner have less than \u00a316,000 in savings. | You can claim New Style ESA, as your partner\u2019s work does not affect it. | You can also claim UC as you and your partner have less than \u00a316,000 in savings.  \n  \nYour partner\u2019s income will be taken into account as you will need to claim UC as a couple.  \n  \nAny New Style ESA you receive will also be taken into account as income but you may still get UC.  \nYou work but you\u2019re off sick and your Statutory Sick Pay has ended.  \n  \nYou\u2019ve paid and/or been credited with NI contributions in the last 2 to 3 years (employed or self\u2013employed). | You can claim New Style ESA. | If you and your partner have less than \u00a316,000 of savings you might also get UC.  \nYou\u2019re ill and unable to work.  \n  \nYou receive pension income from previous employment.  \n  \nYou\u2019ve paid and/or been credited with NI contributions in the last 2 to 3 years (employed or self\u2013employed). | You can claim New Style ESA.  \nYour pension income may be taken into account. | If you and your partner have less than \u00a316,000 of savings you might also get UC.  \n  \nYour pension income will be taken into account.  \n  \nAny New Style ESA you receive will also be taken into account as income but you may still get UC.  \nYou\u2019re ill and unable to work.  \n  \nYou have children.  \n  \nYou\u2019ve paid and/or been credited with NI contributions in the last 2 to 3 years (employed or self-employed). | You can claim New Style ESA as you have paid NI contributions so may qualify.  \n  \nNew Style ESA does not include additional amounts for children. | You can also claim UC, as it is a household assessment and you can receive an amount for children.  \nYou\u2019re ill and unable to work.  \n  \nYou live in rented accommodation, or have a mortgage or home loan, and need help to pay the cost.  \n  \nYou\u2019ve paid and/or been credited with NI contributions in the last 2 to 3 years (employed or self-employed). | You can claim New Style ESA as you have paid NI contributions so may qualify.  \n  \nNew Style ESA does not include an additional amount for housing costs. | You can also claim UC, as it is a household assessment and you can receive an amount for your [housing costs](https://www.gov.uk/housing-and-universal-credit).  \n  \n## Eligibility\n\nTo get New Style ESA you usually need to have been working within the last 2 to 3 years, and have made (or been credited with) Class 1 or Class 2 [National Insurance contributions](https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance).\n\nThis can be through employment or self\u2013employment.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure how much National Insurance you\u2019ve paid, you can [check your National Insurance record](https://www.gov.uk/check-national-insurance-record) online.\n\n## How to apply\n\n### Apply online\n\nYou can

If your assessment is by video call or on the phone, you can ask the assessor to call the person if they\u2019re not with you when the assessment starts.\n\nYou\u2019ll stay on the \u2018assessment rate\u2019 until a decision can be made on your Work Capability Assessment.\n\n## After your claim is assessed\n\nIf you\u2019re entitled to ESA you\u2019ll be placed in one of 2 groups:\n\n  * a work-related activity group (you cannot work now, but can prepare to work in the future, for example by writing a CV)\n  * a support group (you cannot work now and you\u2019re not expected to prepare for work in the future)\n\n\n\nYou will:\n\n  * usually be in the support group if your illness or disability severely limits what you can do\n  * be in the support group if a medical professional has said you might have less than 12 months to live\n\n\n\n### If you\u2019re in the work-related activity group\n\nYou must attend regular interviews with a work coach. They can help you improve your skills or write a CV to help you get back into work.\n\n### If you\u2019re in the support group\n\nYou\u2019re usually in this group if your illness or disability severely limits what you can do. You do not have to go to interviews. You can tell your work coach if you\u2019d like to take part in work-related activities.\n\n## How long you\u2019ll get ESA for\n\nNew Style ESA lasts for 365 days if you\u2019re in the work-related activity group.\n\nThere\u2019s no time limit if you\u2019re in the support group.\n\nTo keep getting ESA you must report any [change in your circumstances](https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance/change-of-circumstances). You may also need to [send fit notes](https://www.gov.uk/send-fit-note) regularly.\n\n## If you get a sanction\n\nYour ESA can be reduced if you do not attend interviews or do work-related activity as agreed with your work coach in your \u2018Claimant Commitment\u2019. This reduction can continue for up to 4 weeks after you restart work-related activities.\n\nYou\u2019ll get a letter to say you may be sanctioned. Tell your work coach if you have a good reason for not doing what was agreed in your \u2018Claimant Commitment\u2019.\n\nYou\u2019ll get another letter if the decision is made to give you a sanction. Your benefit will only be affected once a decision has been made.\n\nYou should [contact your local council](https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council) immediately if you claim Housing Benefit or Council Tax Reduction. They\u2019ll tell you what to do to continue getting support.\n\nIf you get a sanction you can [ask for the decision to be looked at again](https://www.gov.uk/appeal-benefit-decision).\n\nYou will not get a sanction if you\u2019re in the support group.\n\n## If you\u2019ve been paid too much\n\nIf you give wrong or incomplete information or do not report a change straight away, you might be paid too much. If you are, you might have to [pay some of the money back](https://www.gov.uk/benefit-overpayments).\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[UC]: Universal Credit\n  *[NI]: National Insurance\n  *[SSP]: Statutory Sick Pay\n  *[DWP]: Department for Work and Pensions",

      "body": "## Overview\n\nIf you\u2019re already getting benefits for more than 2 children you\u2019ll continue to get those benefits.\n\nYou won\u2019t be paid an additional amount for more than 2 children, unless the children were born before 6 April 2017 (on or before 6 April for Income Support) or special circumstances apply.\n\nIf you\u2019re getting Income Support with \u2018dependents allowance\u2019 for one or more children, and another child joins your household you need to tell the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).\n\nDWP will tell you if the amount of dependents allowance you get will change. This will depend on the new rules for claiming benefits for more than 2 children and your circumstances.\n\nIf you currently claim benefits or tax credits and aren\u2019t moving to Universal Credit until a later date, you\u2019ll continue to be paid an additional amount for each child you look after as long as you remain responsible for the same children and your circumstances remain the same.\n\nBy child (or qualifying young person) we mean anyone aged under 16, or a young person aged under 20 who enrolled on, accepted or started full-time non-advanced education, such as A-levels, or approved training before they turned 19.\n\n## If you\u2019ve already claimed Universal Credit or Child Tax Credit\n\nIf you claimed [Universal Credit](https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit) or [Child Tax Credit](https://www.gov.uk/child-tax-credit) in the previous 6 months but it was stopped for a period of time, you\u2019ll get the same support if you re-claim, as long as you remain responsible for the same children and your circumstances remain the same.\n\nYou will be contacted by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and told when you should claim Universal Credit.\n\nThis is to make sure you don\u2019t lose out financially when you move to Universal Credit. You will need to have been entitled to Severe Disability Premium within the month immediately before you move to Universal Credit.\n\n## If you become responsible for another child\n\nYou should report the birth of a child in the usual way for [Universal Credit](https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit), [Child Tax Credit](https://www.gov.uk/child-tax-credit) and [Income Support](https://www.gov.uk/income-support) so that we can decide if an additional amount can be paid.\n\nIn general, you\u2019ll be entitled to an additional amount for any child or qualifying young person born before 6 April 2017.\n\nIf you\u2019ve another child who isn\u2019t living with you when you claim Universal Credit, but then returns to your household, you\u2019ll be entitled to a child amount for them, as long as they were born before 6 April 2017.\n\nNote: If this happens and you\u2019re being paid Child Tax Credit/Universal Credit for a child born after 6 April 2017, then you may not get Child Tax Credit/Universal Credit for that child unless an exception applies.\n\nIf you\u2019re responsible for a child or children through adoption or as part of non-parental caring arrangement then you\u2019ll be able to receive an additional amount for these children. This will not affect any amounts you may get for any other children in your household. You\u2019ll need to provide documents to support this.\n\n## If you\u2019re making a new claim\n\nIf you\u2019re making a new claim, Universal Credit will pay an additional amount for all children born before 6 April 2017.\n\nIf you have been getting support for children in [Universal Credit](https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit), [Child Tax Credit](https://www.gov.uk/child-tax-credit), [Income Support](https://www.gov.uk/income-support) or [Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance](https://www.gov.uk/jobseekers-allowance) in the last 6 months, you will continue to get the child amount for the same number of children, as long as you remain responsible for the same children.\n\nThis protection will also be maintained through family formation changes, such as splitting from a partner in a joint claim, or coupling to form a new joint claim.\n\nExceptions (special circumstances) that applied in a previous award of [Universal Credit](https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit), [Child Tax Credit](https://www.gov.uk/child-tax-credit), [Income Support](https://www.gov.uk/income-support) or [Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance](https://www.gov.uk/jobseekers-allowance) will continue to apply in your new Universal Credit award, unless the conditions for that exception are no longer met.\n\nIf you are entitled to an award of an existing benefit that includes a Severe Disability Premium, or have been entitled to an award of an existing benefit within the last month that included a Severe Disability Premium, and have continued to meet the Severe Disability Premium eligibility conditions, you cannot currently claim Universal Credit.\n\nYou should, if eligible, claim other benefits or remain on your existing benefits until you are told to claim Universal Credit.\n\nUse a [benefits calculator](https://www.gov.uk/benefits-calculators) to check what benefits you could get if you can\u2019t currently claim Universal Credit.\n\n## Special circumstances\n\nWe call these special circumstances, exceptions.\n\nYou may be able to get the additional child amount for a third or subsequent child or qualifying young person (you are responsible for) born on or after 6 April 2017 (after 6 April 2017 for Income Support) if the child or children:\n\n  * were born as part of a multiple birth\n  * were born as a result of a non-consensual conception (including rape) or conceived when you were in a controlling or coercive relationship\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re responsible for a child or children (regardless of the order they joined the household) who:\n\n  * are adopted from local authority care\n  * are in your care, either formally or informally and it\u2019s likely they would otherwise be looked after by a local authority\n  * are a child of your child\n\n\n\nThen you\u2019ll receive an additional amount for them and this won\u2019t affect any amounts you may get for any other children in your household.\n\nFor all of the exceptions above, you\u2019ll need to provide us with supporting documents.\n\n### Multiple birth\n\nYou can get extra Universal Credit and Child Tax Credit for your third and subsequent children if they\u2019re born as part of a multiple birth, apart from one child in that birth. This means the exception applies to the additional children in that birth.\n\nWhere the first child of the multiple birth is either the first or second child in the household, we\u2019ll pay a child amount for all the children born as part of the multiple birth. This means you can get an additional amount for that child (the first child) as well as the other child or children of the multiple birth.\n\n### Adopted from local authority care\n\nThis exception applies to a child or children adopted from local authority care. You\u2019ll be able to receive an additional amount from the date you become responsible for them, rather than the date the child was born.\n\nThis exception doesn\u2019t apply if:\n\n  * children are adopted from abroad\n  * you or your partner are, or were the step-parent of the adopted child before they were adopted\n\n\n\nSince 28 November 2018, the policy for when we\u2019ll pay for children in non-parental caring arrangements or who are adopted has changed. More information about these changes is available.\n\n### Children living with friends or family under caring arrangements\n\nThis includes:\n\n  * formal caring arrangements, such as a Child Arrangements Order, a Guardianship Order\n\n  * informal caring arrangements if it\u2019s likely the child would otherwise be looked after by a local authority, supporting documents will be required using the [informal care form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-a-child-who-is-informally-living-with-you)\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re caring for a child and either you or your partner are the parent or step-parent of that child, you won\u2019t get an additional child amount for them unless either:\n\n  * they are your first or second child\n\n  * the child was born before 6 April 2017 (on or before 6 April 2017 for Income Support)\n\n\n\n\nIf a child you\u2019re responsible for has a child of their own, you\u2019ll also get the extra child amount for the \u2018child of your child\u2019 until either your:\n\n  * child turns 16 and claims benefit on their own\n\n  * child leaves the household, leaving their child in your care\n\n\n\n\nNote: If your child leaves the household but their child stays in your care, you\u2019ll no longer be able to claim this exception, but you may be able to claim for their child under the non-parental caring arrangements exception.\n\nThis also applies to the child of a qualifying young person for tax credits.\n\nSince 28 November 2018, the policy for when we\u2019ll pay for children in non-parental caring arrangements or who are adopted has changed. More information about these changes is available.\n\n### Non-consensual conception\n\nYou may be able to get the additional child amount for a third or subsequent child if either:\n\n  * your child was born as a result of a non-consensual conception (including rape)\n  * you were in a controlling or coercive relationship with the other biological parent of the child at the time of the conception\n\n\n\nTo get the additional child amount of benefit for this reason you must not be living with the other (biological) parent of the child.\n\nIf you don\u2019t already have documents to support this special circumstance, you\u2019ll need to fill in the [\u2018Support for a child conceived without your consent\u2019 form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-a-child-conceived-without-your-consent) with the help of an approved third party.\n\nFind out which [approved third parties](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-a-child-conceived-without-your-consent) are available.\n\nDWP, HMRC and local authority staff won\u2019t question you about the circumstances of the conception, any information you provide will be kept confidential.\n\nIf you\u2019re eligible to receive the additional amount for your child, the reason for the exception won\u2019t appear in any benefit letters.\n\n## More information about support for children in Universal Credit\n\nRead more information about:\n\n  * [support for a maximum of 2 children in Universal Credit](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/universal-credit-and-families-with-more-than-2-children-information-for-claimants)\n\n  * [support for a maximum of 2 children in Child Tax Credit](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/child-tax-credit-exceptions-to-the-2-child-limit)\n\n  * [support for a maximum of 2 children for Income Support claimants with dependants allowance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/income-support-with-dependants-allowance-the-2-child-payment-limit)\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll still be entitled to additional support in respect of any disabled children, regardless of the total number of children in your household.\n\nYou may still be entitled to help with childcare costs for any of your children, even if you do not get the additional child amount for all of your children.\n\nPassported benefits, for example, free school meals for children won\u2019t be affected.\n\nYou should continue to report the birth of a child and any changes in your circumstances involving children or young people so you do not miss out on what you are entitled to.\n\nChanges to tax credits claims should be reported to HMRC, changes to Universal Credit and other benefits should be reported to DWP.\n\n## Qualifying young person\n\nGenerally, a qualifying young person is someone aged 16 to 19 who is in education or training.\n\nA qualifying young person is someone aged over 16 in any of these situations:\n\n  * in full time education or not - from their 16th birthday until 31 August following that birthday\n\n  * if enrolled in, or accepted for approved training or a course of education which is non-advanced education - up to 31 August following their 19th birthday\n\n\n\n\nThe approved training or course must be provided at a school, college or elsewhere approved by a qualifying body.\n\nThe average time spent during term time in tuition, practical work, supervised study or taking exams must be more than 12 hours a week. Meal breaks and unsupervised study aren\u2019t counted. Where the qualifying young person is aged 19, the education or training must have begun before they reached their 19th birthday, or they must have been enrolled to undertake that education or training before reaching that age.\n  *[DWP]: Department for Work and Pensions\n  *[HMRC]: Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs",

      "body": "If you\u2019re in need of support, you can find out how to [get help with the cost of living through the Household Support Fund from your local council](https://www.gov.uk/cost-living-help-local-council).\n\nOn 30 September 2021, the government announced that vulnerable households across the country would be able to access a new [\u00a3500 million support fund](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-launches-500m-support-for-vulnerable-households-over-winter) to help them with essentials over the winter. This funding covered the period 6 October 2021 to 31 March 2022 inclusive.\n\nThe Household Support Fund was distributed by councils in England to directly help those who needed it most. The grant was distributed through small payments to support vulnerable households meet daily needs such as food, clothing, and utilities.\n\nOn 23 March 2022 the Chancellor announced an extension to the Household Support Fund. The fund was extended to 30 September 2022 with an additional \u00a3500 million of funding to be used by local authorities to support vulnerable households.\n\n## Household Support Fund extension 1 October 2022 to 31 March 2023\n\nOn 26 May 2022 the government announced a further extension to the Household Support Fund. The fund has been extended to 31 March 2023 with an additional \u00a3500 million of funding which will be used by local authorities to support vulnerable households.\n\nIn line with previous grants the [Barnett formula](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/devolved-administration-funding-and-the-barnett-formula) will apply in the usual way to additional funding in England, the devolved governments will receive up to \u00a379 million of the \u00a3500 million (\u00a341 million for the Scottish Government, \u00a325 million for the Welsh Government and \u00a314 million for the Northern Ireland Executive). It will be for the devolved governments to decide how to allocate this additional funding.\n\nThis brings the total amount of funding announced since October 2021 to \u00a33 billion including Barnett impact. This includes over \u00a32.5 billion allocated to Local Authorities in England. It is for the devolved governments to decide how to allocate this additional Barnett funding.\n\n## Household Support Fund extension 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024\n\nOn 17 November 2022, as part of the Chancellor\u2019s Autumn Statement, the government announced an additional \u00a31 billion of funding to help households with the cost of essentials. This brings the total funding for this support to \u00a32.5 billion since October 2021. In England a further \u00a3842 million is being provided to extend the Household Support Fund by a further 12 months from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024. The additional funding will be used by local authorities to support vulnerable households.\n\nIn line with previous grants the [Barnett formula](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/devolved-administration-funding-and-the-barnett-formula) will apply in the usual way for funding for the devolved governments. It will be for the devolved governments to decide how to allocate this additional funding.\n\n## Household Support Fund extension 1 April 2024 to 30 September 2024\n\nIn the Spring Budget the government announced it is providing an additional \u00a3500 million to enable the extension of the Household Support Fund, including funding for the devolved governments through the Barnett formula to be spent at their discretion. This means that Local Authorities in England will receive an additional \u00a3421 million to support those in need locally through the Household Support Fund. \n\nThe funding will be available to Local Authorities in England from 1 April 2024 and will run until 30 September 2024. \n\n## Household Support Fund extension 1 October 2024 to 31 March 2025\n\nOn 2 September, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions announced an additional \u00a3500 million to enable the extension of the Household Support Fund, including funding for the devolved governments through the [Barnett formula](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/devolved-administration-funding-and-the-barnett-formula) to be spent at their discretion. This means that Local Authorities in England will receive an additional \u00a3421 million to support those in need locally through the Household Support Fund. \n\nThe funding will be available to Local Authorities in England from 1 October 2024 to 31 March 2025. This brings the total amount of funding announced since October 2021 to \u00a33.5 billion including Barnett impact. This includes just under \u00a33 billion allocated to Local Authorities in England. It is for the devolved governments to decide how to allocate this additional Barnett funding.",

      "body": "## Overview \n\nThe [minimum wage a worker should get](/national-minimum-wage-rates) depends on their age and if they\u2019re an apprentice.\n\nThe National Minimum Wage is the minimum pay per hour almost all workers are entitled to. The National Living Wage is higher than the National Minimum Wage - workers get it if they\u2019re 21 and over.\n\nIt does not matter how small an employer is, they still have to pay the correct minimum wage.\n\n## Calculate the minimum wage\n\nUse the minimum wage calculators to check if the correct minimum wage has been paid.\n\nThere are separate calculators for workers and employers.\n\nUse the [calculator for workers](/am-i-getting-minimum-wage) to check if you\u2019re getting the correct minimum wage or if an employer owes you payment from the previous year.\n\nUse the [calculator for employers](/minimum-wage-calculator-employers) to check if you\u2019re paying the correct minimum wage or if you owe a payment from the previous year.\n\nThere is also guidance on [working out the minimum wage for different types of work](/minimum-wage-different-types-work).\n\nCall the [Acas helpline](/pay-and-work-rights) for advice about the National Minimum Wage or National Living Wage.\n\n## Who gets the minimum wage \n\n[People classed as \u2018workers\u2019](/employment-status/worker) must be at least [school leaving age](/know-when-you-can-leave-school) to get the National Minimum Wage. They must be 21 or over to get the National Living Wage.\n\nContracts for payments below the minimum wage are not legally binding. The worker is still entitled to the National Minimum Wage or National Living Wage.\n\nWorkers are also entitled to the correct minimum wage if they\u2019re:\n\n  * part-time\n  * casual labourers, for example someone hired for one day\n  * agency workers\n  * workers and homeworkers paid by the number of items they make\n  * apprentices\n  * trainees, workers on probation\n  * disabled workers\n  * agricultural workers\n  * foreign workers\n  * seafarers\n  * offshore workers\n  * non-family members living in the employer\u2019s home who share in the work and leisure activities and are treated as one of the family, for example au pairs\n\n\n\n## Apprentices\n\nApprentices are entitled to the [apprentice rate](/national-minimum-wage-rates) if they\u2019re either:\n\n  * under 19\n  * 19 or over and in the first year of their apprenticeship\n\n\n\nApprentices over 19 who have completed the first year of their apprenticeship are entitled to the correct minimum wage for their age.\n\n## Not entitled to the minimum wage\n\nThe following types of workers are not entitled to the National Minimum Wage or National Living Wage:\n\n  * [self-employed people](/employment-status/selfemployed-contractor) running their own business\n  * [company directors](/employment-status/director)\n  * [people who are volunteers](/volunteering/pay-and-expenses) or voluntary workers\n  * workers on a government employment programme, such as the Work Programme\n  * members of the armed forces\n  * family members of the employer living in the employer\u2019s home\n  * workers younger than school leaving age (usually 16)\n  * higher and further education students on work experience or a work placement up to one year\n  * people shadowing others at work\n  * workers on government pre-apprenticeships schemes\n  * people on the following European Union (EU) programmes: Leonardo da Vinci, Erasmus+, Comenius\n  * people working on a Jobcentre Plus Work trial for up to 6 weeks\n  * share fishermen\n  * prisoners\n  * people living and working in a religious community\n\n\n\nEmployers who offer [internships (sometimes called \u2018work placements\u2019 or \u2018work experience\u2019)](/employment-rights-for-interns) should check if the person is entitled to the minimum wage.\n\n## Voluntary work\n\nYou\u2019re classed as doing voluntary work if you can only get certain limited benefits (for example reasonable travel or lunch expenses) and you\u2019re working for a:\n\n  * charity\n  * voluntary organisation or associated fundraising body\n  * statutory body\n\n\n\nContact the [Acas helpline](/pay-and-work-rights) to find out if you should be getting the minimum wage.\n\n## Employers and the minimum wage \n\nEmployers must pay workers the correct minimum wage.\n\nYou can read guidance on the [minimum wage rates](/national-minimum-wage-rates) and [who they apply to](/national-minimum-wage/who-gets-the-minimum-wage).\n\n## What\u2019s not included in minimum wage calculations\n\nSome payments must not be included when the minimum wage is calculated.\n\nThese are:\n\n  * payments for the employer\u2019s own use or benefit, for example if the employer has paid for travel to work\n  * things the worker bought for the job and is not refunded for, such as tools, uniform, safety equipment\n  * tips, service charges and cover charges\n  * extra pay for working unsocial hours on a shift\n\n\n\nFind out [what counts as working time](/minimum-wage-different-types-work).\n\n## What\u2019s included in minimum wage calculations\n\nSome payments must be included when the minimum wage is calculated.\n\nThese are:\n\n  * Income Tax and National Insurance contributions\n  * wage advances or loans\n  * repayment of wage advances or loans\n  * repayment of overpaid wages\n  * things the worker paid for that are not needed for the job or paid for voluntarily, such as meals\n  * [accommodation provided by an employer](/national-minimum-wage-accommodation) above the offset rate (\u00a39.99 a day or \u00a369.93 a week)\n  * penalty charges for a worker\u2019s misconduct\n\n\n\nExample\n\nJohn is 27 and works 40 hours a week. He earns \u00a311.50 per hour or \u00a3460 a week.\n\nHe pays \u00a310 a week to rent his uniform and the money\u2019s not refunded.\n\nTo calculate his minimum wage, John\u2019s employer must deduct the uniform rental from the pay.\n\nThis means John makes \u00a3450 per week (\u00a3460 minus \u00a310) which is \u00a311.25 per hour. This is below the minimum wage rate of \u00a311.44.\n\nJohn\u2019s employer will need to pay the arrears back to John.\n\nRead the [detailed guidance on calculating the minimum wage](/government/publications/calculating-the-minimum-wage) for more on what counts and does not count towards the minimum wage, eligibility, how to calculate the minimum wage and how it is enforced.\n\n## Employer checks\n\nIt\u2019s a criminal offence for employers to not pay someone the National Minimum Wage or National Living Wage, or to fake payment records.\n\nEmployers who discover they\u2019ve paid a worker below the correct minimum wage must pay any arrears immediately. Use the [National Minimum Wage and National Living Wage calculator for employers](/minimum-wage-calculator-employers) to check a worker has been paid correctly.\n\nHM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) officers have the right to carry out checks at any time and ask to see payment records. They can also investigate employers if a worker complains to them.\n\nIf HMRC finds that an employer has not been paying the correct rates, any arrears have to be paid back immediately. There will also be a fine and offenders might be named by the government.\n\n### Keeping records\n\nIt\u2019s the employer\u2019s responsibility to keep records proving that they are paying the minimum wage. These records must be kept for at least 6 years if they:\n\n  * were created on or after 1 April 2021\n  * still had to be kept on 31 March 2021 under the previous rule that records must be kept for 3 years\n\n\n\nThe period records must be kept for starts from the last day of the pay reference period after the one they cover.\n\nThey do not have to be kept in any particular form, for example they can be paper or computer records. But employers must be able to produce records for an individual pay reference period in a single document.\n\nMost employers use their payroll records as proof of:\n\n  * total pay - including pay deductions, allowances and tips\n  * total hours worked - including absences and overtime\n\n\n\nEmployers may also need to keep records such as:\n\n  * agreements about working hours, pay and conditions, such as contracts\n  * documents that show why a worker is not entitled to the minimum wage\n\n\n\n## Pay reference periods\n\nPay reference periods are usually set by how often someone is paid, for example one week, one month or 10 days. A pay reference period cannot be longer than 31 days.\n\nA worker must be paid the minimum wage, on average, for the time worked in the pay reference period.\n\n## Worker disputes over minimum wage \n\nWorkers who think their pay is below the correct minimum wage rate should talk to their employer first.\n\nIf this does not solve the problem, they can ask the employer in writing to see their payment records. The worker can take someone with them and make copies of the records.\n\nIf an employer owes the worker any arrears they have to pay these back.\n\nWorkers can call the confidential [Acas helpline](/pay-and-work-rights) to help them solve a payment dispute.\n\nWorkers can also [make a complaint to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)](/government/publications/pay-and-work-rights-complaints) about their employer or employment agency or complain on behalf of someone else.\n\n## If the employer refuses payment\n\nIf HMRC find that the employer has not paid they will send them a notice for the arrears plus a fine for not paying the minimum wage.\n\nHMRC can take them to court on behalf of the worker if the employer still refuses to pay.\n\n## Employment tribunal\n\nWorkers can also go directly to the [employment tribunal](/employment-tribunals/taking-a-case-to-an-employment-tribunal) themselves.\n\nWorkers who have been dismissed because of a minimum wage dispute can also complain to the employment tribunal for [unfair dismissal](/dismissal/unfair-and-constructive-dismissal).\n  *[HMRC]: HM Revenue and Customs",

      "body": "## Overview \n\nSpecial educational needs and disabilities (SEND) can affect a child or young person\u2019s ability to learn. They can affect their:\n\n  * behaviour or ability to socialise, for example they struggle to make friends\n  * reading and writing, for example because they have dyslexia\n  * ability to understand things\n  * concentration levels, for example because they have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\n  * physical ability\n\n\n\n## Who to talk to\n\nIf you think your child may have special educational needs, contact the SEN co-ordinator, or \u2018SENCO\u2019 in your child\u2019s school or nursery.\n\n[Contact your local council](/find-your-local-council) if your child is not in a school or nursery.\n\nYour local [Information, Advice and Support (IAS) Service](https://councilfordisabledchildren.org.uk/information-advice-and-support-services-network/find-your-local-ias-service/) can give you advice about SEND.\n\n## Support your child can receive\n\nYour child may be eligible for:\n\n  * [SEN support](/children-with-special-educational-needs/special-educational-needs-support) \\- support given in school, like speech therapy\n  * an [education, health and care (EHC) plan](/children-with-special-educational-needs/extra-SEN-help) \\- a plan of care for children and young people aged up to 25 who have more complex needs\n\n\n\nIf you or your child got [support before September 2014](/children-with-special-educational-needs/support-before-september-2014) this will continue until your local council changes it to an EHC plan.\n\n## Special educational needs support \n\nYour child will get SEN support at their school or college.\n\nYour child may need an [education, health and care (EHC) plan](/children-with-special-educational-needs/extra-SEN-help) if they need more support than their school provides.\n\n## Children under 5\n\nSEN support for children under 5 includes:\n\n  * a written progress check when your child is 2 years old\n  * a child health visitor carrying out a health check for your child if they\u2019re aged 2 to 3\n  * a written assessment in the summer term of your child\u2019s first year of primary school\n  * making reasonable adjustments for disabled children, like providing aids like tactile signs\n\n\n\nNurseries, playgroups and childminders registered with Ofsted follow the [Early Years Foundation Stage](/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2) (EYFS) framework. The framework makes sure that there\u2019s support in place for children with SEND.\n\nTalk to a doctor or health adviser if you think your child has SEND but they do not go to a nursery, playgroup or childminder. They\u2019ll tell you what support options are available.\n\n## Children between 5 and 15\n\nTalk to the teacher or the SEN co-ordinator (SENCO) if you think your child needs:\n\n  * a special learning programme\n  * extra help from a teacher or assistant\n  * to work in a smaller group\n  * observation in class or at break \n  * help taking part in class activities\n  * extra encouragement in their learning, for example to ask questions or to try something they find difficult\n  * help communicating with other children\n  * support with physical or personal care difficulties, for example eating, getting around school safely or using the toilet\n\n\n\n## Young people aged 16 or over in further education\n\nContact the college before your child starts further education to make sure that they can meet your child\u2019s needs.\n\nThe college and your local authority will talk to your child about the support they need.\n\n## Extra help \n\nAn education, health and care (EHC) plan is for children and young people aged up to 25 who need more support than is available through special educational needs support.\n\nEHC plans identify educational, health and social needs and set out the additional support to meet those needs.\n\n## Requesting an EHC assessment\n\nYou can ask [your local authority](/find-your-local-council) to carry out an assessment if you think your child needs an EHC plan.\n\nA young person can request an assessment themselves if they\u2019re aged 16 to 25.\n\nA request can also be made by anyone else who thinks an assessment may be necessary, including doctors, health visitors, teachers, parents and family friends.\n\nIf they decide to carry out an assessment you may be asked for:\n\n  * any reports from your child\u2019s school, nursery or childminder\n  * doctors\u2019 assessments of your child\n  * a letter from you about your child\u2019s needs\n\n\n\nThe local authority will tell you within 16 weeks whether an EHC plan is going to be made for your child.\n\n## Creating an EHC plan\n\n  1. Your local authority will create a draft EHC plan and send you a copy.\n\n  2. You have at least 15 days to comment, including if you want to ask that your child goes to a specialist needs school or specialist college.\n\n  3. Your local authority has 20 weeks from the date they receive the request for the assessment to give you the final EHC plan.\n\n\n\n\n## Disagreeing with a decision\n\nYou can challenge your local authority about:\n\n  * their decision to not carry out an assessment\n  * their decision to not create an EHC plan\n  * the special educational support in the EHC plan\n  * the school named in the EHC plan\n\n\n\nIf you cannot resolve the problem with your local authority, you can [appeal to the Special Educational Needs and Disability (SEND) Tribunal](/courts-tribunals/first-tier-tribunal-special-educational-needs-and-disability).\n\n## Personal budgets\n\nYou may be able to get a personal budget for your child if they have an EHC plan or have been told that they need one.\n\nIt allows you to have a say in how to spend the money on support for your child.\n\nThere are 3 ways you can use your personal budget. You can have:\n\n  * direct payments made into your account - you buy and manage services yourself\n  * an arrangement with your local authority or school where they hold the money for you but you still decide how to spend it (sometimes called \u2018notional arrangements\u2019)\n  * third-party arrangements - you choose someone else to manage the money for you\n\n\n\nYou can have a combination of all 3 options.\n\n## Independent support for children of all ages\n\nIndependent supporters can help you and your child through the new SEN assessment process, including:\n\n  * replacing a statement of special educational needs with a new EHC plan\n  * moving a child from a learning difficulty assessment (LDA) to an EHC plan\n\n\n\nYou can find out how to get local support through:\n\n  * [Council for Disabled Children](https://councilfordisabledchildren.org.uk/what-we-do-0/networks/information-advice-and-support-programme/how-find-and-access-support)\n  * [Information, Advice and Support Service Network](https://councilfordisabledchildren.org.uk/information-advice-and-support-services-network)\n  * your [local authority website](/find-your-local-council) and search for \u2018Local Offer\u2019\n\n## If your child got support before September 2014 \n\nYour child will move to an [education, health and care (EHC)](/children-with-special-educational-needs/extra-SEN-help) plan. This will normally happen at a planned review, or when your child moves school. Your council will tell you which.\n\nYour child will already be getting SEN support if they used to get help through:\n\n  * School Action or School Action Plus\n  * Early Years Action or Early Years Action Plus\n\n\n\n## Support after your child leaves school\n\nIf your child has a statement of special educational needs, they\u2019ll have a \u2018transition plan\u2019 drawn up in Year 9. This helps to plan for their future after they leave school.\n\nThey\u2019ll continue to get support during further education. Your child can also ask for an EHC assessment if they need more help than the school or college can provide.\n\n## Help and advice\n\nYou can call the Contact a Family helpline for help and advice.\n\n**Contact a Family helpline**  \n[helpline@cafamily.org.uk](mailto:helpline@cafamily.org.uk)   \nTelephone: 0808 808 3555   \nMonday to Friday, 9:30am to 5pm  \n[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)\n\nYou can also get help from [Independent Parental Special Education Advice (IPSEA).](http://www.ipsea.org.uk/)\n\n**IPSEA advice line**  \nTelephone: 0800 018 4016   \nMonday to Thursday, 10am to 4pm and 7pm to 9pm   \nFriday, 1pm to 4pm   \n[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and disabilities\n  *[SEN]: special educational needs\n  *[SENCO]: special educational needs co-ordinator\n  *[EHC]: education, health and care\n  *[LDA]: learning difficulty assessments\n  *[IPSEA]: Independent Parental Special Education Advice",

      "body": "## Entitlement \n\nThis guide is also available [in Welsh (Cymraeg)](/cyflogwyr-tal-absenoldeb-mamolaeth).\n\n## Statutory Maternity Leave\n\nEligible employees can take up to 52 weeks\u2019 maternity leave. The first 26 weeks is known as \u2018Ordinary Maternity Leave\u2019, the last 26 weeks as \u2018Additional Maternity Leave\u2019.\n\nThe earliest that leave can be taken is 11 weeks before the expected week of childbirth, unless the baby is born early.\n\nEmployees must take at least 2 weeks after the birth (or 4 weeks if they\u2019re a factory worker).\n\n## Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP)\n\nSMP for eligible employees can be paid for up to 39 weeks, usually as follows:\n\n  * the first 6 weeks: 90% of their average weekly earnings (AWE) before tax\n  * the remaining 33 weeks: \u00a3184.03 or 90% of their AWE (whichever is lower)\n\n\n\nTax and National Insurance need to be deducted.\n\nUse the [SMP calculator](/maternity-paternity-calculator) to work out an employee\u2019s maternity leave and pay.\n\nSome employment types like agency workers, directors and educational workers have [different rules for entitlement](/statutory-maternity-pay-how-different-employment-types-affect-what-you-pay).\n\n## Extra leave or pay\n\nYou can offer more than the statutory amounts if you have a company maternity scheme. You must make sure your maternity leave and pay policies are clear and available to staff.\n\n## Reclaiming payments\n\nEven if you pay an employee more than the statutory amount, you can usually only reclaim 92% of that amount. You may be able to reclaim 103% if you qualify for Small Employers\u2019 Relief. Read more about [reclaiming statutory pay](/recover-statutory-payments).\n\n## If the baby is born early\n\nLeave starts the day after the birth if the baby is born early.\n\nThe employee must give you the child\u2019s birth certificate or a document signed by a doctor or midwife that confirms the actual date of birth.\n\nYou must write to them confirming the new end date for their leave.\n\nFor very premature births, you\u2019ll need to calculate SMP using your payroll software (if it has this feature) or [work it out manually](/statutory-maternity-pay-manually-calculate-your-employees-payments). A very premature birth is where the child is born 15 weeks or more before the due date.\n\n## If the baby dies\n\nEmployees still qualify for leave or pay if the baby:\n\n  * is stillborn after the start of the 24th week of pregnancy\n  * dies after being born\n\n\n\n## Employment rights\n\nAn employee\u2019s [employment rights](/employee-rights-when-on-leave) (like the right to pay, holidays and returning to a job) are protected during maternity leave.\n\nYou still have to pay SMP even if you stop trading.\n\n## Eligibility and proof of pregnancy \n\nSome employees will not qualify for both leave and pay.\n\n## Statutory Maternity Leave\n\nEmployees must:\n\n  * have an [employment contract](/employment-contracts-and-conditions) \\- it does not matter how long they\u2019ve worked for you\n  * give you the [correct notice](/maternity-leave-pay-employees/notice-period)\n\n\n\n## Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP)\n\nEmployees must:\n\n  * be on your payroll in the \u2018qualifying week\u2019 - the 15th week before the expected week of childbirth\n  * give you the [correct notice](/maternity-leave-pay-employees/notice-period)\n  * give you proof they\u2019re pregnant\n  * have been [continuously employed by you](/continuous-employment-what-it-is) for at least 26 weeks up to any day in the qualifying week\n  * earn at least \u00a3123 a week (gross) in an 8-week \u2018relevant period\u2019\n\n\n\nUse the [maternity pay calculator](/maternity-paternity-calculator) to check an employee\u2019s eligibility and work out their relevant period, notice period and statutory maternity pay.\n\nThere are [special rules](/statutory-maternity-pay-employee-circumstances-that-affect-payment) for some employee situations (for example if they leave, become sick or their baby is born before the qualifying week).\n\n## Proof of pregnancy\n\nYou must get proof of the pregnancy before you pay SMP. This is usually a doctor\u2019s letter or a maternity certificate (known as an MATB1 certificate). Midwives and doctors usually issue these 20 weeks before the due date.\n\nThe employee should give you proof within 21 days of the SMP start date. You can agree to accept it later if you want. You [do not have to pay SMP](/maternity-leave-pay-employees/refuse-pay-form-smp1) if you have not received proof of the due date 13 weeks after the SMP start date.\n\nYou must [keep records](/employers-maternity-pay-leave/records) of the proof of pregnancy.\n\nEmployees not entitled to SMP may be able to get [Maternity Allowance](/maternity-allowance) instead.\n\n## Notice period \n\nNotice does not have to be in writing unless you request it.\n\n## Statutory Maternity Leave\n\nAt least 15 weeks before the baby is expected, your employees must tell you the date that:\n\n  * the baby is due\n  * they want to start their maternity leave - they can change this with 28 days\u2019 notice\n\n\n\nYou must then confirm their leave start and end dates in writing within 28 days.\n\nEmployees can change their return to work date if they give 8 weeks\u2019 notice.\n\nYou cannot refuse maternity leave or change the amount of leave your employees want to take.\n\n## Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP)\n\nYour employees must give you 28 days\u2019 notice of the date they want to start their SMP. This is usually the same date they want to start their leave.\n\nYou can refuse to pay SMP if your employee does not give you this notice and they do not give you a reasonable excuse.\n\n## Refuse pay form SMP1 \n\nYou can refuse Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) if the employee does not qualify. They may be able to get [Maternity Allowance](/maternity-allowance) instead.\n\nTo refuse it, give the employee the [SMP1 form](/government/publications/statutory-maternity-pay-employee-not-entitled-form-for-employers) within 7 days of your decision. They must get this form within 28 days of their request for Statutory Maternity Pay or the birth (whichever is earlier).\n\n## Record keeping \n\nYou must keep records for HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), including:\n\n  * proof of pregnancy - usually a doctor\u2019s note or a MATB1 certificate (a photocopy is fine)\n  * the date SMP began\n  * your SMP payments (including dates)\n  * the [SMP you\u2019ve reclaimed](/recover-statutory-payments)\n  * any weeks you did not pay and why\n\n\n\nYou must keep records for 3 years from the end of the tax year they relate to, for example by using [form SMP2](/government/publications/statutory-maternity-pay-record-sheet-smp2) or keeping your own records.\n\n## Help with statutory pay \n\nFor [financial help with statutory pay](/recover-statutory-payments), you can:\n\n  * reclaim payments (usually 92%)\n  * apply for an advance if you cannot afford payments\n\n\n  *[SMP]: Statutory Maternity Pay\n  *[AWE]: average weekly earnings\n  *[HMRC]: HM Revenue and Customs",

Payments can start any time between the 11th week before your baby is due and the day after the baby is born.\n\nThis guide is also available in [Welsh (Cymraeg)](/lwfans-mamolaeth), [British Sign Language (BSL)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYPKvEpJpMg&list=PLC0aQWFFHARwkHsLhAD_iRsB_UHeruv-m) and [easy read format](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/easy-read-maternity-allowance).\n\nAny money you get can affect [your other benefits](/maternity-allowance/what-youll-get).\n\n## Eligibility \n\nYou can get Maternity Allowance for up to 39 weeks if you\u2019ve been either:\n\n  * registered as self-employed for at least 26 weeks in the 66 weeks before your baby\u2019s due\n  * employed for at least 26 weeks in the 66 weeks before your baby\u2019s due\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve been employed, you must have been earning (or classed as earning) \u00a330 a week or more in at least 13 weeks of your employment. The weeks do not have to be together.\n\nYou may still qualify if you\u2019ve recently stopped working. It does not matter if you had different jobs or periods of unemployment.\n\nYou can use the [maternity entitlement calculator](https://www.gov.uk/pay-leave-for-parents) to check your eligibility.\n\n## If you do unpaid work for your spouse or civil partner\u2019s business\n\nYou might get Maternity Allowance for up to 14 weeks if, for at least 26 weeks in the 66 weeks before your baby is due, you:\n\n  * have taken part in unpaid work for the business of your spouse or civil partner\n  * have not been employed or self-employed\n\n\n\nIn the same 26 weeks, your spouse or civil partner must:\n\n  * be registered as self-employed with HMRC\n  * pay Class 2 National Insurance contributions\n\n\n\n## If you lose the baby\n\nYou may still qualify if the baby is either:\n\n  * stillborn from the start of the 24th week of pregnancy\n  * born alive at any point during the pregnancy\n\n## What you'll get \n\nUse the [maternity entitlement calculator](https://www.gov.uk/pay-leave-for-parents) to work out how much you could get.\n\n## If you\u2019re employed or have recently stopped working\n\nYou\u2019ll get \u00a3184.03 a week or 90% of your average weekly earnings (whichever is less) for up to 39 weeks if you\u2019re employed or have recently stopped working.\n\nYou can get Maternity Allowance for up to 39 weeks. This means if you take the full 52 weeks Statutory Maternity Leave, your final 13 weeks will be unpaid.\n\n## If you\u2019re self-employed\n\nYou can get between \u00a327 to \u00a3184.03 a week for up to 39 weeks if you\u2019re self-employed.\n\nHow much you get depends on how many Class 2 National Insurance contributions you\u2019ve made in the 66 weeks before your baby is due.\n\nTo get \u00a3184.03 per week you must have:\n\n  * been registered with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) for at least 26 weeks in the 66 weeks before your baby is due\n  * paid Class 2 National Insurance contributions for at least 13 of the 66 weeks before the baby is due\n\n\n\nYou may get \u00a327 for a few weeks while your contributions are linked to your Maternity Allowance application. Your payments will be increased and backdated if necessary. This can take several weeks.\n\n### If you\u2019ve paid less than 13 weeks of contributions\n\nYour Maternity Allowance will be calculated based on how many weeks of Class 2 National Insurance contributions you\u2019ve made.\n\nIf you\u2019ve not paid any Class 2 National Insurance contributions, you\u2019ll be entitled to \u00a327 per week Maternity Allowance.\n\nYou can top-up your contributions to increase your Maternity Allowance after you apply.\n\n### Increase your Maternity Allowance\n\nAfter you apply, HMRC will contact you if you\u2019ve paid less than 13 weeks of Class 2 National Insurance. They will tell you how many additional contributions you need to get the full amount of Maternity Allowance.\n\nDepending on how many additional contributions you pay, you can get between \u00a327 and \u00a3184.03 per week for up to 39 weeks.\n\nOnce your additional contributions have been linked to your Maternity Allowance application, your payments will be increased and backdated if necessary. This can take several weeks.\n\nClass 2 National Insurance contributions are \u00a33.45 per week.\n\n## If you do unpaid work for your spouse or civil partner\u2019s business\n\nYou can get \u00a327 a week for up to 14 weeks if you do unpaid work for your spouse or civil partner\u2019s business.\n\n## How you\u2019re paid\n\nMaternity Allowance is paid every 2 or 4 weeks.\n\nAll benefits, pensions and allowances are usually [paid straight into your bank, building society or credit union account](https://www.gov.uk/how-to-have-your-benefits-paid).\n\n## Effect on other benefits\n\nWhen you claim Maternity Allowance, some of your other benefit payments may change, but your total benefit payments will usually either go up or stay the same.\n\nThe benefits affected are:\n\n  * Universal Credit\n  * bereavement benefits\n  * Carer\u2019s Allowance\n  * Carer Support Payment\n  * Council Tax Reduction\n  * Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)\n  * Housing Benefit\n  * Income Support\n  * Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA) - this will stop if you get Maternity Allowance\n\n\n\nYou may also be affected by the [benefit cap](/benefit-cap), which limits the total amount of benefit you can get. It applies to most people aged 16 or over who have not reached [State Pension age](/state-pension-age).\n\nUse a [benefits calculator](/benefits-calculators) to work out how your other benefits will be affected.\n\n### If you get Universal Credit\n\nYour Universal Credit payment will be reduced by an amount equal to your Maternity Allowance payment.\n\nYou may get an [extra amount of Universal Credit for your children](/universal-credit/what-youll-get) (whether you get Maternity Allowance or not).\n\n[Report a change on your Universal Credit account](/sign-in-universal-credit) if you start getting Maternity Allowance.\n\nWhich benefits you get will affect which [National Insurance credits](/national-insurance-credits) you\u2019re eligible for. If you get Universal Credit:\n\n  * with Maternity Allowance payments you get Class 1 National Insurance credits, which help you qualify for some other benefits and State Pension\n  * without Maternity Allowance payments you get Class 3 National Insurance credits, which count towards your State Pension only\n\n\n\n## If you\u2019ve been paid too much\n\nYou may have to repay the money if you:\n\n  * did not report a change straight away\n  * gave wrong information\n  * were overpaid by mistake\n\n\n\nFind out how to [repay the money you owe from benefit overpayment](https://www.gov.uk/benefit-overpayments).\n\n## How to claim \n\nYou can apply for Maternity Allowance once you\u2019ve been pregnant for 26 weeks. \n\nPayments can start any time between the 11th week before your baby is due and the day after the baby is born.\n\nTo get the full amount that you\u2019re entitled to, claim within 3 months of your Maternity Allowance start date.\n\nTo claim, you\u2019ll need a [Maternity Allowance (MA1) claim form](/government/publications/maternity-allowance-claim-form). You can either:\n\n  * print it and fill it in\n  * fill it in online and print it\n  * [order a form](https://secure.dwp.gov.uk/ask-for-a-maternity-allowance-claim-form/) if you cannot print it\n\n\n\nThe form has notes to help you fill it in.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to give information about your employment in the 66 weeks before your baby is due (called the \u2018Test Period\u2019). You can use the [Test period calculator](https://secure.dwp.gov.uk/check-your-maternity-allowance-dates/date-baby-due/) to work out these dates.\n\nSend your claim to the address on the form.\n\nCall [Jobcentre Plus](/contact-jobcentre-plus) to ask for alternative formats of the form, such as braille, large print or audio CD.\n\n## What to send with your claim form\n\nYou need to include other documents when you send in your claim form.\n\n### Proof of income\n\nYou need to provide original payslips as proof of income.\n\n### Proof of a due date and birth\n\nYou need to provide proof of your baby\u2019s due date, even if the baby has already been born. This could be:\n\n  * a letter from your doctor or midwife on headed paper\n  * your MATB1 certificate \u2013 this must be an original version and not a photocopy\n\n\n\nIf your baby has already been born, you also need to provide proof of that. This could be:\n\n  * a letter from your doctor or midwife on headed paper \u2013 this can be the same letter as the one proving the due date\n  * your baby\u2019s birth certificate \u2013 this must be an original version and not a photocopy\n  * your MATB1 certificate, if the section about the actual date of birth has been filled in by a doctor or midwife \u2013 this must be an original version and not a photocopy\n\n\n\n### Additional information\n\nYou may also need to provide:\n\n  * your SMP1 form, if you were refused Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) by your employer\n  * more information about your partner\u2019s self-employed business and the unpaid work you do for them, if you\u2019re applying for Maternity Allowance for up to 14 weeks\n\n\n\n## When you\u2019ll hear about your claim\n\nYou should get a decision on your claim within 20 working days.\n\nIf you\u2019re eligible, a form will be sent to you confirming your entitlement and asking you to confirm your last day of employment before leave.\n\n## If you disagree with a decision\n\nYou can [challenge a decision](/mandatory-reconsideration) about your claim. This is called asking for mandatory reconsideration.\n\n## Report a change of circumstances \n\nYou need to report changes in your circumstances that happen while you\u2019re receiving Maternity Allowance, for example if you go back to work.\n\nYour Maternity Allowance could be stopped or reduced if you do not report a change straight away. If you\u2019re paid too much you might have to pay some of the money back. You might also have to pay a \u00a350 fine.\n\nIf you deliberately do not report changes, you\u2019re committing [benefit fraud](/benefit-fraud).\n\n## Changes you need to report\n\nReport a change of circumstances if you:\n\n  * return to work (including \u2018keeping in touch days\u2019)\n  * start or stop work\n  * start a new job\n  * become entitled to Statutory Maternity Pay from your employer\n  * return to unpaid work for your spouse or civil partner\u2019s business\n  * change your address\n  * change your name\n  * change your bank details\n  * move abroad\n  * go to prison or are held in police custody\n  * no longer wish to claim Maternity Allowance\n\n\n\nIf you decide not to return to work after your Maternity Allowance has ended, you do not need to report this. Use a [benefits calculator](/benefits-calculators) to check if you can get other financial support.\n\n### Reporting \u2018keeping in touch days\u2019\n\nYou need to report any days you work for your employer while receiving Maternity Allowance. These are known as \u2018keeping in touch days\u2019.\n\nYou can take up to 10 keeping in touch days without affecting the amount of Maternity Allowance you receive.\n\n## How to report changes\n\nYou can report changes by telephone or by post.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure whether you need to report a change, you can call for advice.\n\n### Report changes by phone\n\nYou need your National Insurance number when you call.\n\nMaternity Allowance helpline  \nTelephone: 0800 169 0283  \nTextphone: 0800 169 0286  \n[Relay UK](https://www.relayuk.bt.com/) (if you cannot hear or speak on the phone): 18001 then 0800 169 0283  \nBritish Sign Language (BSL) [video relay service](https://connect.interpreterslive.co.uk/vrs?ilc=DWP) if you\u2019re on a computer - find out how to [use the service on mobile or tablet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oELNMfAvDxw)  \nMonday to Friday, 10am to 3pm  \nWelsh language: 0800 169 0296  \nMonday to Friday, 8am to 6pm  \n[Find out about call charges](https://www.gov.uk/call-charges)\n\n### Report changes by post\n\nYou need to include your National Insurance number on any letters.\n\nSend details of your changes to:\n\nDWP Maternity Allowance  \n  \nMail Handling Site A  \n  \nWolverhampton  \n  \nWV98 2GL",

      "body": "## Employers and eligible staff \n\nEmployers have to provide a workplace pension scheme for eligible staff as soon as your first member of staff starts working for you (known as your \u2018duties start date\u2019).\n\n## Check you\u2019re an employer\n\nYou\u2019re usually an employer if you deduct tax and National Insurance contributions from an employee\u2019s wages.\n\n[Check you\u2019re an employer](http://www.workplacepensions.gov.uk/employer/am-i-an-employer/) if you\u2019re not sure what your pension responsibilities are, for example you employ a carer or someone to work in your home.\n\n## Who you must enrol\n\nYou must enrol and make an employer\u2019s contribution for all staff who:\n\n  * are aged between 22 and the State Pension age\n  * earn at least \u00a310,000 a year\n  * normally work in the UK (this includes people who are based in the UK but travel abroad for work)\n\n\n\nIf staff become eligible because of a change in their age or earnings, you must put them into your pension scheme and write to them within 6 weeks of the day they meet the criteria.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure what the state pension age is you can use the [State Pension age calculator](https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-age) to find out.\n\nYou do not have to enrol an employee if they give you proof of their [lifetime allowance protection](/tax-on-your-private-pension/lifetime-allowance).\n\n## How to set up a workplace pension scheme \n\nYou must set up a workplace pension scheme for eligible staff if you do not already offer one.\n\nUse The Pensions Regulator\u2019s [tool for employers](https://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/en/employers) to find out what you need to do and when you need to do it.\n\nIf you already have a workplace pension scheme that you\u2019d like to use for automatic enrolment, you must ask the provider if it meets the rules.\n\n## How much you must pay\n\nYou must pay at least 3% of your employee\u2019s \u2018qualifying earnings\u2019 into your staff\u2019s pension scheme.\n\nCheck the pension scheme you\u2019re using to find out what counts as \u2018qualifying earnings\u2019.\n\nUnder most schemes, it\u2019s the employee\u2019s total earnings between \u00a36,240 and \u00a350,270 a year before tax. Total earnings include:\n\n  * salary or wages\n  * bonuses and commission\n  * overtime\n  * statutory sick pay\n  * statutory maternity, paternity or adoption pay\n\n\n\n### Paying contributions\n\nYou must deduct contributions from your staff\u2019s pay each month. You\u2019ll need to pay these into your staff\u2019s pension scheme by the 22nd day (19th if you pay by cheque) of the next month.\n\nYou must pay your contributions for each employee by the date you\u2019ve agreed with your provider every time you run payroll. You must backdate any missed payments.\n\nYou may be fined if you pay late or do not pay the minimum contribution for each member of staff.\n\n## Manage your workplace pension scheme \n\nWhen you\u2019ve set up a workplace pension scheme, you must:\n\n  * check if and when staff should be re-enrolled\n  * manage requests to join and leave your pension scheme\n  * keep records about how you\u2019ve met your legal duties\n  * check if existing staff should be added to your pension scheme, for example when they earn a certain amount\n\n\n\n## Re-enrolment and re-declaration\n\nEvery 3 years after your first member of staff starts working for you, you must re-enrol staff into your pension scheme if they:\n\n  * left your pension scheme more than 12 months before your [re-enrolment date](http://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/en/employers/re-enrolment/choose-your-re-enrolment-date.aspx)\n  * are still in your pension scheme but pay below the minimum contributions level\n\n\n\nIf staff left your pension scheme 12 months or less before your next re-enrolment date, you can choose to re-enrol them on that date or wait until the next re-enrolment date in three years, if they\u2019re still eligible.\n\nYou must write to eligible staff within 6 weeks after your re-enrolment date to tell them you have put them back into your pension scheme.\n\nUse The Pensions Regulator\u2019s tool to [find out your dates for re-enrolment](http://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/en/employers/re-enrolment/choose-your-re-enrolment-date/find-out-your-dates-for-re-enrolment.aspx).\n\nYou must complete a [re-declaration of compliance](http://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/en/employers/re-enrolment/complete-your-re-declaration-of-compliance.aspx) every time you carry out your re-enrolment duties, even if staff were not re-enrolled.\n\nIf you do not complete the re-declaration on time you could be fined.\n\n## Requests to join or leave your pension scheme\n\nAll staff can request to join your pension scheme if they want to. You must [check they are eligible](https://www.gov.uk/workplace-pensions-employers) and put them into the scheme within 1 month of getting their request.\n\nStaff can leave your pension scheme whenever they want. You must take them out of the scheme within one month of getting their request.\n\nIf staff ask to leave your pension scheme within 1 month of joining (known as the \u2018opt-out window\u2019), you will have to refund their contributions within 1 month. If they ask to leave after the opt-out window, their contributions will be kept in their pension until they retire.\n\n## Keep records\n\nYou must keep records of how you\u2019ve met your legal duties for maintaining your pension scheme, including:\n\n  * the names and addresses of staff enrolled\n  * when contributions are paid in\n  * all requests to join or leave your pension scheme\n  * your pension scheme reference or registry number (PSR)\n\n\n\nYou must keep these records for 6 years except for requests to leave your pension scheme which must be kept for 4 years. You must also keep track of the ages and earnings of staff so you can enrol them when they become eligible.\n  *[PSR]: Pension scheme reference or registry number",

You can do this by: \n\n  * setting up [weekly or monthly payments towards your bill](/pay-self-assessment-tax-bill/pay-weekly-monthly)\n  * making one-off payments through your online bank account, using online or telephone banking (Faster Payments), setting up single Direct Debits or by posting cheques\n\n\n\nYou can get help if [you cannot pay your tax bill on time](/difficulties-paying-hmrc/overview).\n\n## Ways to pay\n\nMake sure you pay HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) by the deadline. You\u2019ll be charged interest and may be [charged a penalty](/self-assessment-tax-returns/penalties) if your payment is late.\n\nThe time you need to allow depends on how you pay.\n\nYou can no longer pay at the Post Office.\n\n### Same or next day\n\nYou can pay:\n\n  * [through your online bank account](/pay-self-assessment-tax-bill/approve-payment-through-online-bank-account)\n  * using [online or telephone banking](/pay-self-assessment-tax-bill/bank-details?utm_source=sa-overview&utm_medium=internal-link&utm_campaign=online-or-telephone-banking) (Faster Payments)\n  * by [CHAPS](/pay-self-assessment-tax-bill/bank-details?utm_source=sa-overview&utm_medium=internal-link&utm_campaign=chaps)\n  * by [debit or corporate credit card online](/pay-self-assessment-tax-bill/by-debit-or-credit-card-online?utm_source=sa-overview&utm_medium=internal-link&utm_campaign=debit-or-credit-card-online)\n  * at your [bank or building society](/pay-self-assessment-tax-bill/bank-or-building-society?utm_source=sa-overview&utm_medium=internal-link&utm_campaign=bank-or-building-society)\n\n\n\nYou need a paying-in slip from HMRC to pay at a bank or building society.\n\n### 3 working days\n\nYou can pay by:\n\n  * [Bacs](/pay-self-assessment-tax-bill/bank-details?utm_source=sa-overview&utm_medium=internal-link&utm_campaign=bacs)\n  * [Direct Debit](/pay-self-assessment-tax-bill/direct-debit?utm_source=sa-overview&utm_medium=internal-link&utm_campaign=direct-debit-3) (if you\u2019ve set one up with HMRC before)\n  * [cheque through the post](/pay-self-assessment-tax-bill/by-post?utm_source=sa-overview&utm_medium=internal-link&utm_campaign=by-post)\n\n\n\n### 5 working days\n\nYou can pay by:\n\n  * [Direct Debit](/pay-self-assessment-tax-bill/direct-debit?utm_source=sa-overview&utm_medium=internal-link&utm_campaign=direct-debit-5) (if you have not set one up with HMRC before)\n\n\n\nIf the deadline falls on a weekend or bank holiday, make sure your payment reaches HMRC on the last working day before (unless you\u2019re paying by [Faster Payments](/pay-self-assessment-tax-bill/bank-details?utm_source=sa-overview&utm_medium=internal-link&utm_campaign=faster-payments-callout) or [by debit or credit card](/pay-self-assessment-tax-bill/by-debit-or-credit-card-online?utm_source=sa-overview&utm_medium=internal-link&utm_campaign=by-debit-or-credit-card-callout)).\n\n## Problems with payment services\n\nOnline payment services may be slow during busy times. Check if there are any [current problems or times they are not available](/government/publications/self-assessment-paying-hmrc-service-availability-and-issues).\n\n## Direct Debit \n\nSet up a Direct Debit through your [HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) online account](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/gg/sign-in?continue=/directdebits/welcome&origin=DD-frontend) to make single payments for 31 January.\n\nYou can also set up another Direct Debit if you need to make a [payment on account](/understand-self-assessment-statement/payments-on-account).\n\nIf you want to make more than one payment before the deadline, you\u2019ll need to set up single payments each time you want to pay by Direct Debit.\n\nTo make weekly or monthly Direct Debit payments towards your next Self Assessment tax bill, [set up a Budget Payment Plan](/pay-self-assessment-tax-bill/pay-weekly-monthly).\n\nIf you\u2019ve not used your Direct Debit for 2 years or more, check with your bank that it\u2019s still set up.\n\n## Find the reference number for your Direct Debit\n\nYou\u2019ll need to use your 11-character payment reference. This is your 10-digit Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) followed by the letter \u2018K\u2019.\n\nYou\u2019ll find it either:\n\n  * in your [HMRC online account](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/gg/sign-in?continue=/self-assessment/&origin=SA-frontend)\n  * on your paying-in slip, if you get paper statements\n\n\n\nYour payment may be delayed if you use the wrong reference number.\n\nAllow 5 working days to process a Direct Debit the first time you set one up. It should take 3 working days the next time if you\u2019re using the same bank details.\n\n## Approve a payment through your online bank account \n\nYou can pay your Self Assessment bill directly using your online or mobile bank account. \n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to pay, [start your Self Assessment payment](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/pay/self-assessment/choose-a-way-to-pay). \n\nSelect the \u2018pay by bank account\u2019 option. You\u2019ll then be directed to sign in to your online or mobile banking account to approve a payment to \u2018HMRC Shipley\u2019.\n\nThe payment is usually instant but can take up to 2 hours to show in your bank account.\n\nYou can make more than one payment towards your bill before the deadline. You can select a date to pay, as long as it\u2019s before your payment is due.\n\nCheck your account to make sure that the payment has gone out on the correct day. If the payment has not gone out as expected, speak to your bank.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to have your online banking details ready to pay this way.\n\n## Make an online or telephone bank transfer \n\nYou can pay your Self Assessment bill using Faster Payments, CHAPS or Bacs. You can make more than one payment towards your bill before the deadline.\n\n## Pay by Faster Payments, CHAPS or Bacs\n\nYour bill will tell you which bank account to pay into. If you do not have a bill, or you\u2019re not sure, you can pay into either account.\n\n### Account details to use\n\nPay into one of the following accounts:\n\n  * sort code - 08 32 10\n  * account number - 12001039\n  * account name - HMRC Cumbernauld   \n  \n\n  * sort code - 08 32 10\n  * account number - 12001020\n  * account name - HMRC Shipley\n\n\n\n### If your account is overseas\n\nPay into one of the following accounts:\n\n  * Business Identifier Code (BIC) - BARCGB22\n  * account number (IBAN) - GB62 BARC 2011 4770 2976 90\n  * account name - HMRC Cumbernauld   \n  \n\n  * Business Identifier Code (BIC) - BARCGB22\n  * account number (IBAN) - GB03 BARC 2011 4783 9776 92\n  * account name - HMRC Shipley\n\n\n\nSome banks will charge you if you do not pay in pounds sterling.\n\n### What you\u2019ll need\n\nYou\u2019ll need to use your 11-character payment reference when you pay.

If there\u2019s more than one responsible person, you have to work together to meet your responsibilities.\n\nThe Fire Safety Order also applies if you have paying guests, for example if you run a bed and breakfast, guesthouse or let a self-catering property.\n\nFire safety rules are different [in Scotland](https://www.gov.scot/policies/fire-and-rescue/non-domestic-fire-safety/) and [Northern Ireland](https://www.nifrs.org/home/staying-safe/business-fire-safety/).\n\n## Responsibilities\n\nAs the responsible person you must:\n\n  * carry out a fire risk assessment of the premises and review it regularly\n  * tell staff or their representatives about the risks you\u2019ve identified\n  * put in place, and maintain, appropriate fire safety measures\n  * plan for an emergency\n  * provide staff information, fire safety instruction and training\n\n\n\nYou can read about [your legal duties as the person responsible for fire safety](/government/collections/fire-safety-legislation-guidance-for-those-with-legal-duties).\n\n## Non-domestic premises\n\nNon-domestic premises are:\n\n  * all workplaces and commercial premises\n  * all premises the public have access to\n  * the common areas of multi-occupied residential buildings\n\n\n\n## Shared premises\n\nIn shared premises it\u2019s likely there\u2019ll be more than one responsible person. You\u2019ll need to co-ordinate your fire safety plans to make sure people on or around the premises are safe.\n\nFor common or shared areas, the responsible person is the landlord, freeholder or managing agent.\n\n## Alterations, extensions and new buildings\n\nWhen building new premises or doing building work on existing premises, you must comply with building regulations. This includes designing fire safety into the proposed building or extension.\n\nRead the [fire safety building regulations](/government/publications/fire-safety-approved-document-b).\n\n## Penalties and enforcement\n\nYou could be fined or go to prison if you do not follow fire safety regulations.\n\nLocal fire and rescue authorities inspect premises and can issue [fire safety notices](/workplace-fire-safety-your-responsibilities/enforcement-appeals-and-penalties) telling you about changes you need to make.\n\n## Fire risk assessments \n\nAs the responsible person you must carry out and regularly review a fire risk assessment of the premises. This will identify what you need to do to prevent fire and keep people safe.\n\nYou must keep a written record of your fire risk assessment.\n\n## Carrying out the assessment\n\n  1. Identify the fire hazards.\n\n  2. Identify people at risk.\n\n  3. Evaluate, remove or reduce the risks.\n\n  4. Record your findings, prepare an emergency plan and provide training.\n\n  5. Review and update the fire risk assessment regularly.\n\n\n\n\nThe [fire safety risk assessment chart](/government/publications/fire-safety-risk-assessment-5-step-checklist) gives more detailed information about these steps.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to consider:\n\n  * emergency routes and exits\n  * fire detection and warning systems\n  * fire fighting equipment\n  * the removal or safe storage of dangerous substances\n  * an emergency fire evacuation plan\n  * the needs of vulnerable people, for example the elderly, young children or those with disabilities\n  * providing information to employees and other people on the premises\n  * staff fire safety training\n\n\n\n## Help with the assessment\n\nYou can do the fire risk assessment yourself with the help of standard fire safety risk assessment guides.\n\nIf you do not have the expertise or time to do the fire risk assessment yourself you need to appoint a \u2018competent person\u2019 to help, for example a professional risk assessor.\n\nYour local fire and rescue authority might be able to give you advice if you\u2019re not sure your risk assessment\u2019s been carried out properly. However, they cannot carry out risk assessments for you.\n\n## Assessment guides\n\nYou can download the following guides on risk assessments in:\n\n  * [offices and shops](/government/publications/fire-safety-risk-assessment-offices-and-shops)\n  * [factories and warehouses](/government/publications/fire-safety-risk-assessment-factories-and-warehouses)\n  * [sleeping accommodation](/government/publications/fire-safety-risk-assessment-sleeping-accommodation)\n  * [residential care premises](/government/publications/fire-safety-risk-assessment-residential-care-premises)\n  * [educational premises](/government/publications/fire-safety-risk-assessment-educational-premises)\n  * [small and medium places of assembly (holding 300 people or less)](/government/publications/fire-safety-risk-assessment-small-and-medium-places-of-assembly)\n  * [large places of assembly (holding more than 300 people)](/government/publications/fire-safety-risk-assessment-large-places-of-assembly)\n  * [theatres, cinemas and similar premises](/government/publications/fire-safety-risk-assessment-theatres-cinemas-and-similar-premises)\n  * [open air events and venues](/government/publications/fire-safety-risk-assessment-open-air-events-and-venues)\n  * [healthcare premises](/government/publications/fire-safety-risk-assessment-healthcare-premises)\n  * [animal premises and stables](/government/publications/fire-safety-risk-assessment-animal-premises-and-stables)\n  * [transport premises and facilities](/government/publications/fire-safety-risk-assessment-transport-premises-and-facilities)\n\n\n\nYou can also find guidance on:\n\n  * [risk assessments if you work in construction](http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/books/hsg168.htm)\n  * [purpose-built blocks of flats](http://www.local.gov.uk/fire-safety-purpose-built-flats) and [other types of housing](http://www.cieh.org/policy/fire_safety_existing_housing.html) if you\u2019re a landlord\n\n## Fire safety and evacuation plans \n\nYour plan must show how you have:\n\n  * a clear passageway to all escape routes\n  * clearly marked escape routes that are as short and direct as possible\n  * enough exits and routes for all people to escape\n  * emergency doors that open easily\n  * emergency lighting where needed\n  * training for all employees to know and use the escape routes\n  * a safe meeting point for staff\n\n\n\n## People with mobility needs\n\nYou should also make special arrangements for [people with mobility needs](/government/publications/fire-safety-risk-assessment-means-of-escape-for-disabled-people), for example make sure there are people to help wheelchair users get downstairs if there\u2019s a fire.\n\n## Fire safety equipment, drills and training \n\n## Fire detection and warning systems\n\nYou must have a fire detection and warning system. You may need different types of detectors, depending on the type of building and the work carried out in it.\n\n## Fire fighting equipment\n\nThe types of equipment you need depend on your business premises. You\u2019ll need to have any equipment properly installed, tested and maintained and train your staff to use them if necessary.\n\n### Maintenance and testing\n\nYou must carry out regular checks to make sure that:\n\n  * all fire alarm systems are working\n  * the emergency lighting is working\n  * you record any faults in systems and equipment\n  * all escape routes are clear and the floor is in good condition\n  * all fire escapes can be opened easily\n  * automatic fire doors close correctly\n  * fire exit signs are in the right place\n\n\n\n## Fire drills and training\n\nYou need to train new staff when they start work and tell all employees about any new fire risks.\n\nYou should carry out at least one fire drill per year and record the results. You must keep the results as part of your fire safety and evacuation plan.\n\n## Enforcement, appeals and penalties \n\nYour local fire and rescue authority visits premises to check the fire risk assessment and fire prevention measures are appropriate. Fire safety officers should help you understand the rules and comply with them.\n\nThey can also take action if they think your fire safety measures are not adequate. For example, they might issue an informal notice suggesting safety measures.\n\nThey could also give you a formal fire safety notice. They\u2019ll tell you how to fix the problems described in the notice.\n\n## Alterations notice\n\nYou could get an alterations notice if your premises have high safety risks or will have high safety risks if the use of the premises changes.\n\n## Enforcement notice\n\nYou could get an enforcement notice if the fire and rescue authority finds a serious risk that\u2019s not being managed. It will say what improvements are needed by when.\n\n## Prohibition notice\n\nThese take effect immediately if the fire and rescue authority thinks the fire risk is so great that access to your premises needs to be prohibited or restricted.\n\n## Appeals\n\nYou may be able to arrange an informal review from your fire and rescue authority if you disagree with the decision to issue a fire safety notice.\n\nYou can appeal to your local magistrates\u2019 court within 21 days of receiving a notice.\n\nIn certain circumstances, you and the fire and rescue authority can [ask for a \u2018determination\u2019](/government/publications/regulatory-reform-fire-safety-order-2005-guidance-note-determination-request-process) from the Home Secretary to resolve a dispute.\n\n## Penalties\n\nYou could be fined or go to prison if you do not follow fire safety regulations.\n\nMinor penalties can be up to \u00a35,000. Major penalties can have unlimited fines and up to 2 years in prison.",

      "body": "## Overview \n\nYour employees may be [eligible for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP)](/sick-leave-pay-employees/eligibility-and-form-ssp1), which is [\u00a3116.75 a week](/sick-leave-pay-employees/entitlement) for up to 28 weeks.\n\nThis guide is also available [in Welsh (Cymraeg)](/tal-salwch-statudol-arweiniad-i-gyflogwyr).\n\nYou can offer more if you have a company sick pay scheme but you cannot offer less. Company schemes are also called \u2018contractual\u2019 or \u2018occupational\u2019 sick pay and must be included in an employment contract.\n\nThere\u2019s a separate guide to [Statutory Sick Pay if you\u2019re an employee](/statutory-sick-pay).\n\n## Holiday (or \u2018annual leave\u2019)\n\nStatutory [annual leave](/holiday-entitlement-rights) is accrued while the employee is off work sick (no matter how long they\u2019re off) and can be taken during sick leave.\n\n## Entitlement \n\nThe weekly rate for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) is \u00a3116.75 for up to 28 weeks. It is paid:\n\n  * for the days an employee normally works - called \u2018qualifying days\u2019\n  * in the same way as wages, for example on the normal payday, deducting tax and National insurance\n\n\n\nUse the [SSP calculator](/calculate-statutory-sick-pay) to work out the actual amount, for example for a daily rate.\n\nSome employment types like agency workers, directors and educational workers have [different rules for entitlement](/statutory-sick-pay-how-different-employment-types-affect-what-you-pay). You may still have to pay SSP even if you [stop trading](/statutory-sick-pay-business-changes-that-affect-payment#you-cease-to-trade).\n\nYou cannot force your employees to take annual leave when they\u2019re eligible for sick leave.\n\n## When to start paying SSP\n\nSSP is paid when the employee is sick for more than 3 days in a row (including non-working days).\n\nYou cannot count a day as a sick day if an employee has worked for a minute or more before they go home sick.\n\nIf an employee works a shift that ends the day after it started and becomes sick during the shift or after it has finished, the second day will count as a sick day.\n\nYou do not pay an employee SSP for the first 3 working days they\u2019re off sick unless both of the following apply:\n\n  * you\u2019ve paid them SSP within the last 8 weeks\n  * you did not pay them SSP for the first 3 working days at that time\n\n\n\n## When to stop paying SSP\n\nSSP stops when the employee comes back to work or no longer [qualifies for it](/sick-leave-pay-employees/eligibility-and-form-ssp1).\n\n## Record keeping\n\nYou do not need to keep records of SSP paid to employees.\n\nYou can choose how you keep records of your employees\u2019 sickness absence. HMRC may need to see these records if there\u2019s a dispute over payment of SSP.\n\n## Eligibility and form SSP1 \n\nTo qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) employees must:\n\n  * have an [employment contract](/employment-contracts-and-conditions)\n  * have done some work under their contract\n  * have been sick for more than 3 days in a row (including non-working days) - known as a \u2018period of incapacity for work\u2019\n  * earn an average of at least \u00a3123 per week\n  * give you [notice and proof of illness](/employers-sick-pay/notice-and-fit-notes) when needed\n\n\n\nEmployees who have been paid less than 8 weeks of earnings still qualify for SSP. Use the [sick pay calculator](/calculate-statutory-sick-pay) to work out how much to pay them.\n\nAn employee\u2019s period of incapacity for work is not interrupted if they take [annual leave](/holiday-entitlement-rights) during that time.\n\nEmployees can qualify for sick pay from more than one job.\n\nThey could also qualify in one job but be fit for work in another, for example if one job is physical work that they cannot do while ill but the other is office-based.\n\n## Exceptions\n\nEmployees do not qualify for SSP if they:\n\n  * have received the maximum amount of SSP (28 weeks)\n  * are getting Statutory Maternity Pay or Maternity Allowance - there are [special rules](/statutory-sick-pay-employee-circumstances-that-affect-payment#your-employee-is-pregnant) for pregnant women and new mothers who do not get these payments\n  * are off work for a pregnancy-related illness in the 4 weeks before the week (Sunday to Saturday) that their baby is due\n  * were in custody or [on strike](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/statutory-sick-pay-employee-circumstances-that-affect-payment#your-employee-is-involved-in-a-trade-dispute-with-you) on the first day of sickness (including any linked periods)\n  * are working outside the EU and you\u2019re not liable for their National Insurance contributions\n  * received Employment and Support Allowance within 12 weeks of starting or returning to work for you\n\n\n\nUse the [SSP calculator](/calculate-statutory-sick-pay) to check eligibility.\n\n### Linked periods of sickness\n\nIf your employee has regular periods of sickness, they may count as \u2018linked\u2019. To be linked, the periods must:\n\n  * last more than 3 days each\n  * be 8 weeks or less apart\n\n\n\nYour employee is no longer eligible for SSP if they have a continuous series of linked periods that lasts more than 3 years.\n\n## If an employee is not eligible or their SSP ends\n\nEmployees may be able to apply for [Universal Credit](/universal-credit) or [Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)](/employment-support-allowance). They use [form SSP1](/government/publications/statutory-sick-pay-employee-not-entitled-form-for-employers) to support their application.\n\nIf your employee\u2019s SSP is ending you must send them form SSP1 either:\n\n  * within 7 days of their SSP ending, if it ends unexpectedly while they\u2019re still sick\n  * on or before the beginning of the 23rd week, if their SSP is expected to end before their sickness does\n\n\n\nIf your employee does not qualify for SSP you must send them form SSP1 within 7 days of their first day off sick.\n\nIf your employee thinks this is unfair, they can appeal to HMRC \\- the form tells them how to do this.\n\n## Long-term illness\n\nYou can complete [form SSP1](/government/publications/statutory-sick-pay-employee-not-entitled-form-for-employers) before the end of SSP if you know an employee will be off sick for more than 28 weeks. This means they can apply for ESA before their SSP comes to an end.\n\n## Notice and fit notes \n\nThe employee should tell you they\u2019re sick within the time limit set by you, or 7 days if you do not have one. You cannot insist they tell you in person or on a special form.\n\nYou do not have to pay Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) for any days the employee was late in telling you (unless there\u2019s a good reason for the delay).\n\nExample\n\nAn employee is sick from Monday 3 June. They usually work from Monday to Friday.\n\nYou\u2019ve set your time limit at 5 days\u2019 notice, but they only tell you they\u2019re sick after 7 days (on Monday 10 June).\n\nYou do not have to pay them SSP for the 2 days they were late telling you.\n\nYou [start paying SSP](/employers-sick-pay/entitlement) on Thursday 13 June - on the fourth \u2018qualifying day\u2019 (days an employee usually works on) after they told you they were sick.\n\n## Fit notes and asking for proof\n\nYou can only ask for a fit note if your employee is off work for more than 7 days in a row (including non-working days).\n\nYou cannot withhold SSP if the employee is late sending you a fit note.\n\nIf your employee is off sick frequently or for a long time, HMRC has information about [getting medical advice](/statutory-sick-pay-employee-fitness-to-work).\n\n### Fit notes\n\nA fit note (sometimes called a sick note) must be issued by one of the following healthcare professionals:\n\n  * GP or hospital doctor\n\n  * registered nurse\n\n  * occupational therapist\n\n  * pharmacist\n\n  * physiotherapist\n\n\n\n\nThe note can be printed or digital.\n\n### Other proof of sickness\n\nIf you agree, the employee can give you a similar document from a physiotherapist, podiatrist or occupational therapist instead of a fit note. This is called an Allied Health Professional (AHP) Health and Work Report.\n\n## Help with sick pay \n\n## If you\u2019re insolvent\n\nHMRC will pay SSP for any employee who continues to work for you if they were sick when you became insolvent. Tell your employee to contact the Statutory Payment Disputes Team.\n\nStatutory Payment Disputes Team   \nTelephone: 03000 560 630   \n[Find out about call charges](/call-charges).\n\nIf their sickness continues and you terminate their contract, give them a completed [SSP1 form](/government/publications/statutory-sick-pay-employee-not-entitled-form-for-employers) so they can claim Employment and Support Allowance instead.\n  *[SSP]: Statutory Sick Pay\n  *[HMRC]: HM Revenue and Customs\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance",

The first 26 weeks is known as \u2018Ordinary Adoption Leave\u2019, the last 26 weeks as \u2018Additional Adoption Leave\u2019.\n\nLeave can start:\n\n  * on the date the child starts living with the employee or up to 14 days before the expected placement date (UK adoptions)\n  * when an employee has been matched with a child to be placed with them by a UK adoption agency\n  * when the child arrives in the UK or within 28 days of this date (overseas adoptions)\n  * the day the child\u2019s born or the day after (parents in surrogacy arrangements)\n\n\n\n## Statutory Adoption Pay\n\nStatutory Adoption Pay (SAP) for employees is:\n\n  * 90% of their gross average weekly earnings for the first 6 weeks\n  * \u00a3184.03 a week or 90% of their gross average weekly earnings (whichever is lower) for the next 33 weeks\n\n\n\nTax and National Insurance need to be deducted.\n\nCalculate an employee\u2019s adoption leave and pay using the [maternity and paternity calculator](/maternity-paternity-calculator).\n\nSome employment types like agency workers, directors and educational workers have [different rules for entitlement](/statutory-adoption-pay-how-different-employment-types-affect-what-you-pay).\n\n## Extra leave or pay\n\nYou can offer more than the statutory amounts if you have a company scheme for adoption leave and pay. You must make sure your scheme\u2019s policies are clear and available to staff.\n\n## Reclaiming payments\n\nEven if you pay an employee more than the statutory amount, you can usually only reclaim 92% of that amount. You may be able to reclaim 103% if you qualify for Small Employers\u2019 Relief.

This includes if the statutory leave is for another child.\n\nIf an employee\u2019s Parental Bereavement Leave is interrupted by the start of another type of statutory leave, they can take their remaining entitlement to Parental Bereavement Leave after that other leave has ended.\n\nThe remaining Parental Bereavement Leave must still be taken within 56 weeks of the date of death or stillbirth.\n\nParental Bereavement Leave can be taken between blocks of shared parental leave which had already been booked when the child died, even if the shared parental leave is for another child.\n\n## Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay\n\nStatutory Parental Bereavement Pay for an eligible employee is either \u00a3184.03 a week or 90% of their average weekly earnings (whichever is lower). Tax and National Insurance need to be deducted.\n\nCalculate an employee\u2019s Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay using [Basic PAYE tools](/basic-paye-tools) or [guidance on manual calculation](/guidance/manually-calculate-your-employees-statutory-parental-bereavement-pay).\n\nSome employment types, like agency workers, directors and educational workers, have [different rules for entitlement](/guidance/how-different-employment-types-affect-what-you-pay-in-statutory-parental-bereavement-pay).\n\n## Extra leave or pay\n\nYou can offer more than the statutory amounts if you have a company scheme for parental bereavement leave and pay. You must make sure your scheme\u2019s policies are clear and available to staff.\n\n## Reclaiming payments\n\nEven if you pay an employee more than the statutory amount, you can usually only reclaim 92% of that amount. You may be able to reclaim 103% if you qualify for Small Employers\u2019 Relief. Read more about [reclaiming statutory pay](/recover-statutory-payments).\n\n## Employment rights\n\nAn [employee\u2019s rights](/employee-rights-when-on-leave) (like the right to pay rises, holidays and returning to a job) are protected during Parental Bereavement Leave.\n\nYou still have to pay Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay even if you stop trading.\n\n## Eligibility \n\nTo qualify for Parental Bereavement Leave and Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay, an employee must meet the criteria both as a parent (including if they had day to day responsibility) and an employee. They might not be eligible for both.\n\n## If the employee was the child\u2019s parent or the parent\u2019s partner\n\nAn employee will be eligible if, at the time of the child\u2019s death or stillbirth, they were:\n\n  * the child\u2019s or baby\u2019s parent - either biological, adoptive or parent of a child born to a surrogate\n  * the partner of the child\u2019s or baby\u2019s parent\n\n\n\nBiological parents are not eligible once an adoption or parental order has been made unless there was a contact order in place after the adoption.\n\n### If the employee was not the child\u2019s parent but had day to day responsibility for the child\n\nAn employee may be eligible if they or their partner had:\n\n  * the child or baby living with them at their home for 4 continuous weeks, ending with the date of the death\n  * day to day responsibility for the child or baby\u2019s care during that time\n\n\n\nIf the employee or their partner was paid to look after the child, they\u2019re not entitled to leave or pay unless they were:\n\n  * a foster parent paid a fee or allowance by a local council\n  * reimbursed for expenses to do with the care of the child or baby\n  * getting payments under the terms of a will or trust for the child or baby\u2019s care\n\n\n\nAn employee is not eligible if one of the child or baby\u2019s parents or someone who had [parental responsibility](/parental-rights-responsibilities) ([parental responsibilities in Scotland](https://www.mygov.scot/parental-responsibilities-rights/)) for the child was also living in the household.\n\n### If the employee was an adoptive parent\n\nIf they or their partner was an adoptive parent, an employee is eligible:\n\n  * after the [adoption order](/child-adoption/applying-for-an-adoption-court-order) was granted\n  * before the adoption order was granted, if the child was placed with them for adoption and the placement was not disrupted (for example, being temporarily placed elsewhere) or stopped\n\n\n\n### If the employee was an adoptive parent of a child from outside the United Kingdom\n\nIf the employee or their partner was adopting a child from outside the United Kingdom and the court order had not yet been made, they may still be eligible. Both of the following must apply:\n\n  * the child was living with them after entering the United Kingdom\n  * they have the \u2018official notification\u2019 confirming they were allowed to adopt\n\n\n\n### If the employee had a baby with the help of a surrogate parent\n\nIf they or their partner were a parent of a child born to a surrogate, an employee is eligible:\n\n  * after a parental order was made\n  * before a parental order was made if they had applied or intended to apply for a parental order within 6 months of the child\u2019s birth and expected it to be granted\n\n\n\n## Parental Bereavement Leave\n\nTo get Parental Bereavement Leave, the employee must also:\n\n  * be [classed as an employee](/employment-status/employee) \\- it does not matter how long they\u2019ve worked for you\n  * give you the [correct notice](/employers-parental-bereavement-pay-leave/notice-period) for Parental Bereavement Leave\n\n\n\n## Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay\n\nTo get Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay, the employee must have been [continuously employed by you](/continuous-employment-what-it-is) for at least 26 weeks up to the end of the \u2018relevant week\u2019. The \u2018relevant week\u2019 is the week (ending with a Saturday) immediately before the week of the death or stillbirth.\n\nThey must also:\n\n  * remain employed by you up to the day the child dies or is stillborn\n  * earn on average \u00a3123 a week (gross)\n  * give you the [correct notice](/employers-parental-bereavement-pay-leave/notice-period) for Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay\n\n\n\nUse the [guidance on manual calculation](/guidance/manually-calculate-your-employees-statutory-parental-bereavement-pay) to check entitlement and to work out the relevant week.\n\nThere are [special rules](/guidance/employee-circumstances-that-affect-payment-of-statutory-parental-bereavement-pay) for some employee situations, for example if they leave or become sick.\n\n## Notice period \n\nAn employee must give notice for Parental Bereavement Leave as well as evidence for Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay.\n\n## Parental Bereavement Leave\n\nAn employee has 56 weeks to take Parental Bereavement Leave. This starts from the date of the child\u2019s death.\n\nThe 56 weeks is split into 2 periods:\n\n  * from the date of the death or stillbirth to 8 weeks after\n  * 9 to 56 weeks after the date of the death or stillbirth\n\n\n\nThey can take 2 weeks\u2019 leave in one block or as 2 separate blocks of one week.\n\nYou must get notice from the employee before they take Parental Bereavement Leave. How much notice depends on when they\u2019re taking leave.\n\n### 0 to 8 weeks after the child\u2019s death or stillbirth\n\nAn employee must give you notice before the time they would normally start work on the first day of the period they want to take off work.\n\n### 9 to 56 weeks after the child\u2019s death or stillbirth\n\nAn employee must give you at least one week\u2019s notice before the start of the week or weeks they want to take off work.\n\n### How employees should give you notice\n\nThey should tell you:\n\n  * the date of the child\u2019s death or stillbirth\n  * when they want their Parental Bereavement Leave to begin\n  * how much leave they are taking - either 1 or 2 weeks\n\n\n\nAn employee can give you notice informally, for example by phone, text message or email.\n\nYou cannot ask for:\n\n  * notice for leave in writing (such as following up with an email, letter or form)\n  * notice to cancel leave in writing\n  * evidence of entitlement for leave\n  * details about the employee\u2019s relationship to the child or baby\n\n\n\n### Cancelling Parental Bereavement Leave\n\nAn employee can cancel their Parental Bereavement Leave if they\u2019ve given you more than the required notice for taking leave.\n\nIf they were starting the leave within 8 weeks of the death or stillbirth, they must let you know about the cancellation no later than the time they would normally start work on the first day of planned leave.\n\nIf they were starting the leave 9 weeks or later after the death or stillbirth, they must let you know no later than one week before the start of the planned leave.\n\nThey can rebook another week\u2019s leave if they cancel before the leave was due to start and they give you the correct notice.\n\n## Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay\n\nAn employee must ask for Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay within 28 days, starting with the first day of the week they want to claim pay for.\n\nThey must give you in writing (for example, a letter or email) each time:\n\n  * the dates of the period the want to claim Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay\n  * their name\n  * the date of the child\u2019s death or stillbirth\n\n\n\nThe employee will also need to give you a self declaration to confirm they are [eligible because of their relationship to the child or baby](/employers-parental-bereavement-pay-leave/eligibility) \\- they only need to provide this once when they first ask for pay.\n\n### Cancelling Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay\n\nAn employee can cancel their Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay if they\u2019ve given you more than the required notice for claiming pay.\n\nIf their pay was due to start within 8 weeks of the child\u2019s death or stillbirth, they must give you notice on the first day of the week of pay they want to cancel.\n\nIf their pay was due to start 9 weeks or later after the child\u2019s death or stillbirth, they must tell you they want to cancel one week before their pay was due to start.\n\n## Non-payment form \n\nYou can refuse Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay if the employee does not qualify.\n\nTo do this, send them a completed [non-payment form (SPBP1)](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/submissions/new-form/tell-employee-not-eligible-statutory-parental-bereavement-pay) or your own equivalent form within 28 days of their pay request with evidence. You should keep a record of the week which was refused and the reason why.\n\nIf an employee is unhappy with your decision, they can [contact the HMRC Statutory Payments Disputes Team](/guidance/statutory-pay-entitlement-how-to-deal-with-disagreements). They must do this within 6 months of the start date of the Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay period they claimed.\n\n## Record keeping \n\nYou must keep records for HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), including:\n\n  * the start date for any period Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay was paid\n  * the payments you\u2019ve made (including dates)\n  * a copy of the evidence of entitlement from the employee for Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay including their written declaration, name and date of the child\u2019s death or stillbirth\n  * details of any weeks the employee claimed Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay but you did not pay and the reason why\n\n\n\nYou must keep records for 3 years from the end of the tax year they relate to.\n\nYou can use HMRC\u2019s [record keeping form (SPBP2)](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/submissions/new-form/record-claims-statutory-parental-bereavement-pay) or your own.\n\n## Get help with statutory pay \n\nFor financial help with statutory pay, you can:\n\n  * [reclaim payments](/recover-statutory-payments)\n  * apply for an advance if you cannot afford payments\n\n\n\n## Apply for an advance if you cannot afford payments\n\nYou can apply online for an advance to pay for an employee\u2019s Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay.\n\n[Contact HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)](/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/employer-enquiries) if you\u2019ve got questions about advance payments.\n\nBefore you start, you\u2019ll need:\n\n  * your employer PAYE reference\n  * your payment or account office reference numbers - this is on the letter when you first registered as an employer\n  * the amount of tax or National Insurance owed to HMRC\n  * bank or building society details for you or the third party it\u2019s being paid to\n  * a completed [R38 form](/government/publications/income-tax-tax-claim-r38) if the advance is being paid to a third party\n  * your email address or Government Gateway ID and password\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll also need information about the employee including their:\n\n  * National Insurance number\n  * average weekly earnings\n  * parental bereavement leave and pay arrangements - you can get this information from their self declaration\n\n\n\n[ Apply now ](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/submissions/new-form/apply-for-advance-payment-statutory-parental-bereavement-pay)\n\n### After you\u2019ve applied\n\nIf the advance is being paid to a third party and you\u2019re sending a completed R38 form by post, send it to HMRC within 4 weeks of applying for an advance.\n\nCorporate Treasury   \nHMRC   \nBX9 1BG   \n\n\nOnce your application has been approved, the money will be paid to the bank or building society account you provided or you\u2019ll be sent a cheque (payable order), depending on which payment option you chose.\n\nIf there are any issues with your application, HMRC will contact you directly.\n\n### Paying back your advance payment\n\nYou\u2019ll need to [pay back your advance payment](/recover-statutory-payments/if-you-cant-afford-to-make-payments) through Employer Payment Summary (EPS).\n  *[HMRC]: HM Revenue and Customs",

Employers must work out each worker\u2019s status in both employment law and tax law.\n\nIf someone is classed as an employee for tax purposes, their employer must tell HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) when the person [starts being an employee](/new-employee) or [stops being an employee](/employee-leaving).\n\n## Employment rights\n\nAll employees are workers, but an employee has extra employment rights and responsibilities that do not apply to workers who are not employees.\n\nThese rights include all of the rights [workers](/employment-status/worker) have and:\n\n  * [Statutory Sick Pay](/statutory-sick-pay-ssp)\n  * [statutory maternity pay and leave](/maternity-pay-leave) (workers only get pay, not leave)\n  * [statutory paternity pay and leave](/paternity-pay-leave) (workers only get pay, not leave)\n  * [statutory adoption pay and leave](/adoption-pay-leave) (workers only get pay, not leave)\n  * [statutory shared parental pay and leave](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay) (workers only get pay, not leave)\n  * minimum notice periods if their employment will be ending, for example if an employer is dismissing them\n  * protection against [unfair dismissal](/dismissal/unfair-and-constructive-dismissal)\n  * the right to request [flexible working](/flexible-working)\n  * [time off for emergencies](/time-off-for-dependants)\n  * [Statutory Redundancy Pay](/redundant-your-rights/redundancy-pay)\n\n\n\nSome of these rights require a minimum length of [continuous employment](/continuous-employment-what-it-is) before an employee qualifies for them. An employment contract may state how long this qualification period is.\n\n## Working out employment status for an employee\n\nSomeone who works for a business is probably an employee if most of the following are true:\n\n  * they\u2019re required to work regularly unless they\u2019re on leave, for example [they\u2019re on holiday](/holiday-entitlement-rights) or [on sick leave](/taking-sick-leave) or [on maternity leave](/maternity-leave)\n  * they\u2019re required to do a minimum number of hours and expect to be paid for time worked\n  * a manager or supervisor is responsible for their workload, saying when a piece of work should be finished and how it should be done\n  * they cannot send someone else to do their work\n  * they get paid holiday\n  * they\u2019re entitled to contractual or [Statutory Sick Pay](/statutory-sick-pay-ssp) and to [maternity pay](/statutory-maternity-pay) or to [paternity pay](/paternity-pay)\n  * they can join the business\u2019s pension scheme\n  * the business\u2019s disciplinary and grievance procedures apply to them\n  * they work at the business\u2019s premises or at an address specified by the business\n  * their contract sets out redundancy procedures\n  * the business provides the materials, tools and equipment for their work\n  * they only work for the business or if they do have another job, it\u2019s completely different from their work for the business\n  * their contract, statement of terms and conditions or offer letter (which can be described as an [\u2018employment contract\u2019](/employment-contracts-and-conditions/overview)) uses terms like \u2018employer\u2019 and \u2018employee\u2019\n\n\n\nIf most of these do not apply, you should work out if the person is [self-employed](/employment-status/selfemployed-contractor).\n\nIndividuals and their employers may have to pay unpaid tax and penalties, or lose entitlement to benefits, if their employment status is wrong.\n\n### Check employment status for tax purposes\n\nFor tax purposes, you can [check someone\u2019s employment status online](/guidance/check-employment-status-for-tax) to see if a worker should be classed as employed or self-employed.\n\n## Employee shareholders \n\nAn employee shareholder is someone who works under an [employment contract](/employment-contracts-and-conditions/overview) and owns at least \u00a32,000 worth of shares in the employer\u2019s company or parent company.\n\n## Employment rights\n\nEmployee shareholders have most of the same employment rights as [people who are workers](/employment-status/worker) and as [people who are employees](/employment-status/employee).\n\nThey also have the right to collective redundancy consultation and [transfer of undertakings (TUPE)](http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1655) \\- this protects the employee\u2019s terms and conditions when the business is transferred to a new owner.\n\nEmployee shareholders do not have these rights:\n\n  * protection against [unfair dismissal](/dismissal/unfair-and-constructive-dismissal) \\- apart from dismissal on grounds of discrimination and in relation to health and safety\n  * [statutory redundancy pay](/redundant-your-rights/redundancy-pay)\n  * the right to request [flexible working](/flexible-working) \\- except in the 2 weeks after returning from parental leave\n  * certain statutory rights to request time off for training\n\n\n\nEmployee shareholders must give 16 weeks\u2019 notice if they want to come back early from:\n\n  * [maternity leave](/maternity-pay-leave/overview)\n  * [additional paternity leave](/paternity-pay-leave/leave)\n  * [adoption leave](/adoption-pay-leave/leave)\n\n\n\nEmployers can choose more generous employment rights than the statutory ones.\n\n## Tax relief and obligations\n\nEmployee shareholders can get [tax relief](/tax-employee-share-schemes/employee-shareholder-shares) on the first \u00a32,000 of shares they get before 1 December 2016.\n\nEmployee shareholders must pay [tax on buying and selling shares](/tax-buying-selling-shares/selling-shares).\n\nHM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has further guidance on [tax relief for employee shareholders](/guidance/employee-shareholders).\n\n## Applying for employment shareholder jobs\n\nAnyone can apply for an employee shareholder job.\n\nPeople claiming Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance do not have to apply for an employee shareholder job that Jobcentre Plus have told them about.\n\nExisting employees do not have to accept a change to an employment contract to become an employee shareholder if they do not want to.\n\n## Offering employment shareholder status\n\nEmployers must following certain [rules when offering employment shareholder status](/employee-shareholders) to their employees.\n\n## Self-employed and contractor \n\nA person is self-employed if they run their business for themselves and take responsibility for its success or failure.\n\nSelf-employed workers are not paid through PAYE, and they do not have the [rights and responsibilities of an employee](/employment-status/employee).\n\nIf someone:\n\n  * becomes self-employed, they must [check if they need to set up a business](/set-up-business)\n  * stops being self-employed, they should [tell HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)](/stop-being-self-employed)\n\n\n\nSomeone can be both employed and self-employed at the same time, for example if they work for an employer during the day and run their own business in the evenings.\n\n## Employment rights\n\nEmployment law does not cover self-employed people in most cases because they are their own boss.\n\nIf a person is self-employed, they have:\n\n  * protection of their health and safety\n  * protection of their [rights against discrimination](/discrimination-your-rights) (in some cases)\n  * the rights and responsibilities set out by the terms of the contract they have with their client\n\n\n\n## Working out if someone is self-employed\n\nHMRC may regard someone as self-employed for tax purposes even if they have a different status in employment law.\n\nEmployers should check if a worker is self-employed in:\n\n  * tax law - in case the worker is exempt from the employer\u2019s PAYE scheme\n  * employment law - in case the worker has employee or worker rights\n\n\n\nIndividuals and their employers may have to pay unpaid tax and penalties, or lose entitlement to benefits, if their employment status is wrong.\n\n### Checking if they\u2019re self-employed for tax purposes\n\nFor tax purposes, you can [check someone\u2019s employment status online](/guidance/check-employment-status-for-tax) to see if a worker should be classed as employed or self-employed.\n\nThere are [special rules for businesses supplying workers](/guidance/employment-status-employment-intermediaries), for example an employment agency.\n\n### Checking their employment rights\n\nIf someone is self-employed, they do not have the [rights and responsibilities of an employee](/employment-status/employee) or the [rights and responsibilities of a worker](/employment-status/worker).\n\nSomeone is probably self-employed if they\u2019re self-employed for tax purposes and most of the following are true:\n\n  * they put in bids or give quotes to get work\n  * they\u2019re not under direct supervision when working\n  * they submit invoices for the work they\u2019ve done\n  * they\u2019re responsible for paying their own National Insurance and tax\n  * they do not get holiday or sick pay when they\u2019re not working\n  * they operate under a contract (sometimes known as a \u2018contract for services\u2019 or \u2018consultancy agreement\u2019) that uses terms like \u2018self-employed\u2019, \u2018consultant\u2019 or an \u2018independent contractor\u2019\n\n\n\n## Contractors\n\nA contractor can:\n\n  * be self-employed\n  * have the [employment status of a worker](/employment-status/worker)\n  * have the [employment status of an employee](/employment-status/employee) if they work for a client and are employed by an agency\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a special scheme for self-employed contractors and sub-contractors working in the construction industry called the [Construction Industry Scheme](/what-is-the-construction-industry-scheme) (CIS).\n\nContractor rules changed on 6 April 2021. Your employment status and the way you pay tax may have changed. Check the [off-payroll working rules for IR35](/guidance/understanding-off-payroll-working-ir35).\n\n## Director \n\nCompany directors run [limited companies](/running-a-limited-company) on behalf of shareholders.\n\nDirectors have different rights and responsibilities from employees, and are classed as [office holders](/employment-status/office-holder) for tax and [National Insurance contribution](/national-insurance-rates-letters/contribution-rates) purposes.\n\nIf a person does other work that\u2019s not related to being a director, they may have an employment contract and get employment rights.\n\n## Office holder \n\nA person who\u2019s been appointed to a position by a company or organisation but does not have a contract or receive regular payment may be an office holder. This includes:\n\n  * statutory appointments, such as registered company directors or secretaries, board members of statutory bodies, or crown appointments\n  * appointments under the internal constitution of an organisation, such as club treasurers or trade union secretaries\n  * appointments under a trust deed, such as trustees\n  * ecclesiastical appointment, such as members of the clergy\n\n\n\nOffice holders are neither employees nor workers. However, it\u2019s possible for someone to be an office holder and an employee if they have an employment contract with the same company or organisation that meets [the criteria for employees](/employment-status/employee).\n\n## Working out employment status for an office holder\n\nSomeone is likely to be an office holder if most of these statements apply to them:\n\n  * there is no contract or service agreement relating to their appointment\n  * their duties are minimal, and are only those required under the relevant statute, constitution or trust deed\n  * they do not get a salary or any other form of regular payment for their services\n  * the only payment they get is a voluntary payment (honorarium), regardless of the work they do - tax and National Insurance are deducted by the appointing body\n  * they\u2019re effectively working as an independent office, and are not under the close supervision or control of the appointing body\n\n## Legal decisions on employment status \n\nA court or [employment tribunal](/employment-tribunals/taking-a-case-to-an-employment-tribunal) (known as an [industrial tribunal](http://www.employmenttribunalsni.co.uk/) in Northern Ireland) can make a final decision on employment status for employment rights purposes. They\u2019ll look at how the employment relationship between the person and the business works in practice.\n\nHM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) may separately argue that someone is self-employed for tax purposes. This may be confirmed by the tax tribunal and the courts.\n\nAn employment tribunal or court may still make a decision that someone is a worker or employee for employment rights purposes.\n  *[Acas]: Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service\n  *[HMRC]: HM Revenue and Customs\n  *[CIS]: Construction Industry Scheme",

      "body": "## Entitlement \n\nAlmost all people [classed as workers](/employment-status/worker) are legally entitled to 5.6 weeks\u2019 paid holiday a year (known as statutory leave entitlement or annual leave).\n\nThis includes:\n\n  * agency workers\n  * workers with \u2018irregular hours\u2019 (where the number of hours they work in a pay period often or always changes)\n  * \u2018part-year\u2019 workers (where there are periods of at least a week in a leave year where they do not need to work and are not paid)\n\n\n\nAn employer can include bank holidays as part of statutory annual leave.\n\n## Statutory annual leave entitlement\n\nMost workers who work a 5-day week must receive at least 28 days\u2019 paid annual leave a year. This is the equivalent of 5.6 weeks of holiday. \n\n### Working part-time\n\nPart-time workers who work regular hours for the whole year are entitled to at least 5.6 weeks\u2019 paid holiday, but this will amount to fewer than 28 days. \n\nFor example, if they work 3 days a week, they must get at least 16.8 days\u2019 leave a year (3 \u00d7 5.6).\n\nUse the [holiday entitlement calculator](/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement) to work out a part-time worker\u2019s leave.\n\n### Working irregular hours or for part of the year\n\nPeople working irregular hours or part of the year are entitled to up to 5.6 weeks statutory leave.\n\nThey will build up (\u2018accrue\u2019) leave depending on the hours they\u2019ve already worked, rather than getting a fixed number of days or hours.\n\nUse the [holiday entitlement calculator](/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement) to work out how much leave they\u2019ve accrued in a pay period.\n\nFor leave years beginning on or before 31 March 2024, leave entitlement for irregular-hours and part-year workers does not need to be accrued based on hours they\u2019ve already worked. You can use the [holiday entitlement calculator](/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement) to estimate their entitlement based on the average days or hours they work each week.\n\n### Limits on statutory leave\n\nStatutory paid holiday entitlement is limited to 28 days. For example, staff working 6 days a week are only entitled to 28 days\u2019 paid holiday.\n\n### Bank holidays\n\nBank or public holidays do not have to be given as paid leave.\n\nAn employer can choose to include bank holidays as part of a worker\u2019s statutory annual leave.\n\n## Extra leave\n\nAn employer can choose to offer more leave than the legal minimum. They do not have to apply all the rules that apply to statutory leave to the extra leave. For example, a worker might need to be employed for a certain amount of time before they become entitled to it.\n\n## Other aspects of holiday entitlement\n\nWorkers have the right to:\n\n  * [get holiday pay](/holiday-entitlement-rights/holiday-pay-the-basics)\n  * build up holiday entitlement during certain types of leave, such as maternity, paternity, or adoption leave\n  * build up holiday entitlement while off work sick\n  * request holiday at the same time as [sick leave](/taking-sick-leave)\n\n\n\n## Disputes\n\nPaid annual leave is a legal right that an employer must provide. If a worker thinks their rights to leave and pay are not being met there are a number of ways to [resolve the dispute](/solve-workplace-dispute).\n\n## Calculate leave entitlement \n\nFor regular-hours workers, employers can use a \u2018leave year\u2019 or an \u2018accrual\u2019 system to work out how much leave their staff should get.\n\nFor irregular-hours and part-year workers, employers must use a specific accrual system.\n\nFor leave years beginning on or before 31 March 2024, employers can use either a leave year or an accrual system to work out leave for irregular-hours or part-year workers. You can use the [holiday entitlement calculator](/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement) to estimate their entitlement based on the average days or hours they work each week.\n\n## Leave year\n\nAn employer should tell their staff the dates of their statutory leave year as soon as they start working, for example, it might run from 1 January to 31 December.\n\nWorkers must take their statutory leave during this time. If a leave year is not set out in a contract then it will start:\n\n  * on the first day of a new job (if started after 1 October 1998)\n  * on 1 October (if started on or before 1 October 1998)\n\n\n\nThe leave year and holiday entitlement is not affected by maternity, paternity or adoption leave. The employee still builds up (\u2018accrues\u2019) holiday over these periods.\n\n### Leave entitlement when starting a new job\n\nIf a worker starts their job part-way through a leave year, they\u2019re only entitled to part of their total annual leave for the current leave year. What they get depends on how much of the year is left.\n\nUse the [holiday entitlement calculator](/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement) to work out how much leave someone has left.\n\n## Accrual system\n\nFor regular hours workers, annual leave begins to build up (\u2018accrue\u2019) as soon as they start their job. An employer can use an accrual system to work out a worker\u2019s leave during the first year of the job. Under this system, a worker gets one-twelfth of their leave in each month.\n\nExample\n\nSomeone works a 5-day week and is entitled to 28 days\u2019 annual leave a year. After their third month in the job, they\u2019d be entitled to 7 days\u2019 leave (a quarter of their total leave, or 28 \u00f7 12 \u00d7 3).\n\n### Irregular-hours or part-year workers\n\nEmployers need to use a specific accrual system to calculate leave for irregular-hours or part-year workers.\n\nIf their leave year began on or before 31 March 2024, employers do not need to use this system until their leave year renews.\n\nThe amount of leave depends on:\n\n  * how often they get paid (their \u2018pay period\u2019) \n\n  * how many hours they worked in a pay period\n\n\n\n\nTheir entitlement will be 12.07% of the hours they worked in a pay period. It must be rounded up to the nearest hour if the entitlement is 0.5 of an hour or more.\n\nFor example, if they worked 30 hours and are paid weekly, they\u2019ll have earned 4 hours leave (30 \u00d7 12.07 \u00f7 100 = 3.621). They can take this leave from their next pay period.\n\n## Carrying over leave\n\nThe worker\u2019s contract says how many days\u2019 leave they can carry over into the next year.\n\nIf a worker gets 28 days\u2019 leave, they can carry over a maximum of 8 days.\n\nIf a worker gets more than 28 days\u2019 leave, their employer may allow them to carry over any additional untaken leave. Check the employment contract, company handbook or intranet to see what the rules say.\n\n### Workers on parental or sick leave\n\nIf a worker cannot take some or all of their leave entitlement because they\u2019re on family-related leave, for example parental leave, they can carry over their untaken leave into next year.\n\nIf a worker could not take their leave entitlement because they were sick, they can carry over:\n\n  * up to 20 of their 28 days\u2019 leave entitlement if they work regular hours for the whole year\n  * up to 28 days of their leave entitlement if they work irregular hours or for part of the year\n\n\n\n### If a worker was unable to take leave\n\nWorkers can carry over their whole leave entitlement if any of the following apply:\n\n  * they did not receive [\u2018rolled-up holiday pay\u2019](/holiday-entitlement-rights/holiday-pay-the-basics) that they were entitled to\n  * they were not given reasonable opportunity to take leave\n  * they were not told that they would lose their leave if they did not take it by the end of the leave year\n\n## Holiday pay \n\nWorkers are entitled to a week\u2019s pay for each week of statutory leave that they take.\n\nMost workers are entitled to 5.6 weeks\u2019 paid holiday a year. You can use the [holiday calculator](/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement) to work out how much leave someone should get.\n\n## How to work out a week\u2019s pay\n\nA week\u2019s pay is worked out according to the kind of hours someone works and how they\u2019re paid for the hours. This includes full-time, part-time, term-time and casual workers.\n\nWorking pattern | How a week\u2019s pay is calculated  \n---|---  \nRegular hours and fixed pay (full- or part-time) | A worker\u2019s pay for a week  \nShift work with regular hours (full- or part-time) | The average number of weekly fixed hours a worker has worked in the previous 52 weeks, at their average hourly rate  \nIrregular-hours and part-year work | A worker\u2019s average pay from the previous 52 weeks (only counting weeks in which they were paid)  \n  \n## Calculating average hourly or weekly rate\n\nTo calculate average hourly rate, only the hours worked and how much was paid for them should be counted. Take the average rate over the last 52 weeks.\n\nA \u2018week\u2019 usually runs from Sunday to Saturday. Only use another 7-day period (like Thursday to Wednesday) if that\u2019s how a worker\u2019s pay is calculated.\n\nIf no pay was paid in any week, count back another week so the rate is based on 52 weeks in which pay was paid. You can count back a maximum of 104 weeks to find these. \n\nIf a worker has less than 52 weeks of pay, use the average pay rate for the full weeks they have worked.\n\n## Workers who are paid monthly\n\nTo work out a week\u2019s pay for someone who\u2019s paid monthly:\n\n  1. Calculate the worker\u2019s average hourly pay for the last month. Do this by dividing the month\u2019s pay by the number of hours worked in the month.\n\n  2. Calculate the weekly pay. Do this by multiplying the average hourly pay by the number of hours worked in a week.\n\n\n\n\nUse the weekly pay calculation for each of the last 52 weeks to work out an average week\u2019s pay.\n\n## \u2018Basic\u2019 and \u2018normal\u2019 rate of pay\n\nFor regular-hours workers (full- or part-time), employers must pay:\n\n  * at least 4 weeks of the worker\u2019s statutory entitlement at their \u2018normal\u2019 rate of pay\n  * the remaining 1.6 weeks at a \u2018basic\u2019 rate of pay\n\n\n\nFor workers who work part of the year, employers must also follow these rules if the worker\u2019s leave year began on or before 31 March 2024.\n\nFor irregular-hours workers or those who work part of the year, all leave must be paid at their \u2018normal\u2019 rate of pay.\n\n\u2018Normal\u2019 rate of pay includes commission, regular overtime payments, and any payments related to length of service or professional qualifications. It does not usually include bonus payments.\n\n## Rolled-up holiday pay\n\nFor regular-hours workers (full- or part- time), an employer cannot include an amount for holiday pay in the hourly rate (known as \u2018rolled-up holiday pay\u2019).\n\nEmployers can use rolled-up holiday pay for irregular-hours and part-year workers, unless their leave year began on or before 31 March 2024.\n\n## More information\n\nThere\u2019s [guidance for calculating holiday pay for workers without fixed hours or pay](/government/publications/calculating-holiday-pay-for-workers-without-fixed-hours-or-pay), which includes several examples.\n\nYou can also contact the [Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas)](https://www.acas.org.uk/contact) with questions about general holiday pay issues.\n\nAcas helpline   \nTelephone: 0300 123 11 00  \nTextphone: 18001 0300 123 1100  \nMonday to Friday, 8am to 6pm   \n[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)\n\n## Booking time off \n\nThe general notice period for taking leave is at least twice as long as the amount of leave a worker wants to take, plus 1 day. For example, a worker would give 3 days\u2019 notice for 1 day\u2019s leave.\n\nAn employer can refuse a leave request or cancel leave but they must give as much notice as the amount of leave requested, plus 1 day. For example, an employer would give 11 days\u2019 notice if the worker asked for 10 days\u2019 leave.\n\nIf the contract says something different about the notice a worker or employer should give, what\u2019s in the contract will apply.\n\nAlthough employers can refuse to give leave at a certain time, they cannot refuse to let workers take the leave at all.\n\n## Part leave days\n\nSome workers may be entitled to a part leave day - for example if they\u2019re part-time or have a half day\u2019s leave to take. How a part day should be taken is up to the employer.\n\n## When leave can and cannot be taken\n\nEmployers can:\n\n  * tell their staff to take leave, for example bank holidays or Christmas\n  * restrict when leave can be taken, for example at certain busy periods\n\n\n\nThere may be rules about this in the employment contract.\n\nThe notice period for this is at least twice as long as the leave they want their staff to take. The employer must tell the worker before the notice period begins.\n\nIf an employer wants a worker to take leave, they need to make sure that the worker can relax, rest and enjoy leisure during their holiday. For example, an employer cannot force a sick worker to take leave.\n\n## Taking holiday before leaving a job \n\nDuring their notice period the worker may be able to take whatever is left of their statutory annual leave.\n\nUse the [holiday entitlement calculator](/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement) to work this out. How much they get depends on how much of the leave year has passed or how much leave they\u2019ve accrued.\n\n## Taking more leave than the entitlement\n\nIf a worker has taken more leave than they\u2019re entitled to, their employer must not take money from their final pay unless it\u2019s been agreed beforehand in writing. The rules in this situation should be outlined in the employment contract, company handbook or intranet.\n\n## Getting paid instead of taking holidays\n\nThe only time someone can get paid in place of taking statutory leave (known as \u2018payment in lieu\u2019) is when they leave their job. Employers must pay for untaken statutory leave, even if the worker is dismissed for gross misconduct.\n\nIf an employer offers more than 5.6 weeks\u2019 annual leave, they can agree separate arrangements for the extra leave.\n  *[Acas]: Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service",

An employer can use an accrual system to work out a worker\u2019s leave during the first year of the job. Under this system, a worker gets one-twelfth of their leave in each month.</p>\n\n<div class=\"example\">\n  <p>Example</p>\n\n  <p>Someone works a 5-day week and is entitled to 28 days\u2019 annual leave a year.

You may find it helpful to suggest what you would like them to do to solve your problem.\n\nYour employer should discuss any disciplinary issues with you informally first. These issues could lead to formal disciplinary action, including [dismissal in more serious or repetitive cases](/dismissal).\n\n## Right to be accompanied\n\nYou have the right to be accompanied to grievance or disciplinary meetings (and any appeals) by either a:\n\n  * colleague or trade union representative\n  * family member or Citizens Advice Bureau worker if this allowed - check your employment contract, company handbook or human resources intranet site\n\n## Formal procedures \n\nYou can make a formal grievance complaint or face formal disciplinary action if you were not able to resolve your problem informally.\n\n## Grievances\n\nYou can make a formal grievance complaint if you\u2019ve tried solving a problem by talking to your manager but you\u2019re not satisfied.\n\nYour employer should put their grievance procedure in writing. You should be able to find this in your:\n\n  * company handbook\n  * human resources (HR) or personnel manual\n  * HR intranet site\n  * employment contract\n\n\n\nYour employer\u2019s grievance procedure should include these steps:\n\n  * writing a letter to your employer setting out the details of your grievance\n  * a meeting with your employer to discuss the issue\n  * the ability to [appeal your employer\u2019s decision](/solve-workplace-dispute/appeals)\n\n\n\nRead the [Acas guidance on discipline and grievances at work](https://www.acas.org.uk/disciplinary-and-grievance-procedures) for more information.\n\n## Disciplinary action\n\nYou might face disciplinary action if your employer has decided they have a serious issue with you or your work.\n\nYour employer should put their disciplinary procedure in writing and it should contain:\n\n  * your employer\u2019s disciplinary procedure rules\n  * what performance and behaviour might lead to disciplinary action\n  * what action your employer might take and your right to [appeal your employer\u2019s decision](/solve-workplace-dispute/appeals)\n\n\n\nRead the [Acas guidance on discipline and grievances at work](https://www.acas.org.uk/disciplinary-and-grievance-procedures) for more information.\n\n### Suspension from work\n\nIf you are facing discipline over a serious issue, your employer may be able to suspend you during the time leading up to a disciplinary meeting.\n\nCheck your employment contract, company handbook or HR intranet site to see if you\u2019re entitled to be paid when suspended.\n\n## Using the Acas Code of Practice\n\nThe result of your claim could be affected if either you or your employer do not follow the [Acas Code of Practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures](https://www.acas.org.uk/acas-code-of-practice-on-disciplinary-and-grievance-procedures) and you go to an [employment tribunal](/employment-tribunals).\n\nIn this situation a tribunal can adjust the amount of compensation awarded by up to 25%.\n\n## Appeals \n\nYou can appeal the result of a grievance or disciplinary procedure. Your appeal must be in writing.\n\n## Appeals procedure\n\nYour employer\u2019s grievance and disciplinary procedures will set out:\n\n  * who you should submit your appeal to\n  * the time limit within which an appeal must be made\n  * any meetings that will be held\n  * how the appeal meeting will be run\n\n\n\nYou have the right to be accompanied during any appeal meetings.\n\n## Mediation, conciliation and arbitration \n\nYou can get help from a third-party to solve disputes between you and your employer. The main ways you can do this are through:\n\n  * mediation\n  * conciliation\n  * arbitration\n\n\n\n## Mediation\n\nMediation is when an independent and impartial third party discusses a problem with you and your employer (or between you and another employee) to try and find a solution. It\u2019s often used after informal discussions have not come up with a solution.\n\nMediation is voluntary and the mediator cannot force you or your employer to accept a solution. Both you and your employer must agree on the way to solve the dispute.\n\nMediation should not be used to solve problems that have to be formally investigated (for example, harassment or discrimination).\n\nYou can also [find a mediation service](https://civilmediation.org/results/).\n\nRead the [Acas guide on mediation](https://www.acas.org.uk/mediation) for more information.\n\n## Conciliation\n\nConciliation is similar to mediation but is normally used to try to find a solution:\n\n  * before you make a claim to an employment tribunal (known as early conciliation)\n  * after you make a claim to an employment tribunal (known as conciliation)\n\n\n\nConciliation is voluntary - both you and your employer must agree to it before it happens.\n\nAcas can offer a free service to help to settle a claim or potential claim.\n\nRead the [Acas guide on conciliation](https://www.acas.org.uk/early-conciliation) for more information.\n\nIf you\u2019re part of a group of employees in dispute with your employer, read the [Acas guide on collective conciliation](https://www.acas.org.uk/collective-conciliation) for more information.\n\n## Arbitration\n\nArbitration is when a third-party makes a firm decision on a case after considering all the issues.\n\nYou and your employer must agree to an arbitrator\u2019s decision being legally binding. If you do not agree, you can still [take a case to an employment tribunal](/employment-tribunals).\n\nRead the [Acas guide on arbitration](https://www.acas.org.uk/arbitration) for more information.\n\n## Tribunals \n\nIf you have been unable to solve a problem between you and your employer, you may have to go to an [employment tribunal](/employment-tribunals).\n\nAt the tribunal, you and your employer will present your cases, answer questions and the tribunal will make a decision.\n\n## Help and advice \n\nCall Acas, contact [Citizen\u2019s Advice](http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/) or speak to your [trade union](/join-trade-union/role-of-your-trade-union-rep) or staff representative for help and advice.\n\nAcas helpline   \nTelephone: 0300 123 1100   \nTextphone: 18001 0300 123 1100   \nMonday to Friday, 8am to 6pm  \n[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)\n  *[HR]: Human resources\n  *[Acas]: Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service",

      "body": "## Overview \n\nIt is against the law to treat someone less favourably than someone else because of a personal characteristic such as religion, sex, gender reassignment or age.\n\nDiscrimination can include:\n\n  * not hiring someone\n  * selecting a particular person for redundancy\n  * paying someone less than another worker without good reason\n\n\n\nYou can discriminate against someone even if you do not intend to. For example, you can discriminate indirectly by offering working conditions or rules that disadvantage one group of people more than another.\n\n## Discrimination in recruitment \n\n## Discrimination in job adverts\n\nYou must not state or imply in a job advert that you\u2019ll discriminate against anyone. This includes saying that you are not able to cater for workers with a disability.\n\nOnly use phrases like \u2018recent graduate\u2019 or \u2018highly experienced\u2019 when these are actual requirements of the job. Otherwise you could discriminate against younger or older people who might not have had the opportunity to get qualifications.\n\nWhere you advertise might cause indirect discrimination - for example, advertising only in men\u2019s magazines.\n\n### Get help advertising a job without discriminating\n\n**Employer Services Line**   \nTelephone: 0800 169 0178   \nTextphone: 0800 169 0172   \n[Video relay service](https://connect.interpreterslive.co.uk/vrs?ilc=DWP) for British Sign Language (BSL) users - [check you can use the service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oELNMfAvDxw)   \nMonday to Friday, 9am to 5pm   \n[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)\n\n## Questions you cannot ask when recruiting\n\nYou must not ask candidates about [\u2018protected characteristics\u2019](/discrimination-your-rights/types-of-discrimination) or whether they:\n\n  * are married, single or in a civil partnership\n  * have children or plan to have children\n\n\n\n### Asking about health or disability\n\nYou can only ask about health or [disability](/recruitment-disabled-people) if:\n\n  * there are necessary requirements of the job that cannot be met with [reasonable adjustments](/reasonable-adjustments-for-disabled-workers)\n  * you\u2019re finding out if someone needs help to take part in a selection test or interview\n  * you\u2019re using \u2018[positive action](/recruitment-disabled-people/encouraging-applications)\u2019 to recruit a disabled person\n\n\n\nYou might be breaking the law if any discrimination happens during their recruitment process, even if you use a recruitment agency.\n\n## Asking for a date of birth\n\nYou can only ask for someone\u2019s date of birth on an application form if they must be a certain age to do the job, for example selling alcohol.\n\nYou can ask someone their date of birth on a separate equality monitoring form. You should not let the person selecting or interviewing candidates see this form.\n\n## Spent criminal convictions\n\nApplicants do not have to tell you about [criminal convictions that are spent](/exoffenders-and-employment). You must treat the applicant as if the conviction has not happened, and cannot refuse to employ the person because of their conviction.\n\nThere are some areas of employment that are exempt from this rule, for example schools.\n\n## Trade union membership\n\nYou must not use membership of a trade union as a factor in deciding whether to employ someone. This includes:\n\n  * not employing someone because they\u2019re a member of a trade union\n  * insisting someone joins a trade union before you\u2019ll employ them\n\n\n\n## Employing people with protected characteristics\n\nYou can choose a candidate who has a [protected characteristic](/discrimination-your-rights/types-of-discrimination) over one who does not if they\u2019re both suitable for the job and you think that people with that characteristic:\n\n  * are underrepresented in the workforce, profession or industry\n  * suffer a disadvantage connected to that characteristic (for example people from a certain ethnic group are not often given jobs in your sector)\n\n\n\nYou can only do this if you\u2019re trying to address the under-representation or disadvantage for that particular characteristic. You must make decisions on a case by case basis and not because of a certain policy.\n\nYou cannot choose a candidate who is not as suitable for the job just because they have a protected characteristic.\n\n## Favouring disabled candidates\n\nWhen a disabled person and a non-disabled person both meet the job requirements, you can treat the disabled person more favourably.\n\n## Discrimination in work \n\nYou must not discriminate against your workers. This could be done by, for example:\n\n  * introducing policies or benefits that discriminate between workers, for example a benefit for married workers that\u2019s not available for people in a civil partnership\n  * paying men and women different amounts (this includes benefits, for example company cars) to do the same job\n  * choosing someone for redundancy because they have a protected characteristic\n  * failing to [make reasonable adjustments](/reasonable-adjustments-for-disabled-workers) for a disabled worker\n  * firing someone for making an allegation of discrimination\n  * firing someone because they\u2019re a union member\n  * unfairly rejecting a [request for flexible working](/flexible-working)\n\n\n\nThis includes self-employed people on a contract for you.\n\nYou cannot promote or train workers just because of their age or the time they\u2019ve worked for you.\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to ask workers about their future career plans, including retirement. These questions should only be asked in discussions about career development and not based on the employee\u2019s age.\n\n## Preventing discrimination\n\nYou can help prevent discrimination by:\n\n  * having an equality, diversity and inclusion policy\n  * providing regular anti-discrimination training\n  * making it clear what workers should do if discrimination happens\n\n\n\nFind out more about [how to prevent discrimination at work on the Acas website](https://www.acas.org.uk/discrimination-and-the-law/what-an-employer-can-do-to-prevent-discrimination).\n\nYou\u2019re responsible for any instances of discrimination at work unless you can show you\u2019ve done everything you reasonably could to prevent or stop it.\n\n## Employment tribunals\n\nA worker who thinks they\u2019ve been discriminated against can [raise a grievance](/solve-workplace-dispute/formal-procedures) or take their case to an employment tribunal.\n\n## Employing family members\n\nIf you hire members of your family you must:\n\n  * avoid special treatment in terms of pay, promotion and working conditions\n  * make sure tax and [National Insurance contributions](/national-insurance) are done correctly\n\n\n\n## Gender reassignment\n\nAs soon as a worker tells their employer that they\u2019re having gender reassignment, they\u2019re protected from discrimination. Discrimination includes:\n\n  * disadvantaging the worker because they have to take time off for medical treatment\n  * not allowing the worker to use facilities appropriate to their gender (for example, toilets)\n\n\n\nTo avoid discrimination, you must:\n\n  * change your records (for example, human resources records) when the worker has a Gender Reassignment Certificate and a new birth certificate\n  * make sure you keep any information the worker gives you about their gender history completely confidential",

      "body": "## Introduction to PAYE \n\nAs an employer, you normally have to operate PAYE as part of your payroll. PAYE is HM Revenue and Customs\u2019 (HMRC) system to collect Income Tax and National Insurance from employment.\n\n## When you must register\n\nYou must register for PAYE if any of the following applies to an employee in the current tax year (since 6 April):\n\n  * they\u2019re paid \u00a3123 or more a week\n  * they get expenses and company benefits\n  * they\u2019re getting a pension\n  * they\u2019ve had another job\n  * they\u2019ve received Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance or Incapacity Benefit\n\n\n\nIf you do not need to register, you\u2019ll still need to keep [payroll records](/paye-for-employers/keeping-records).\n\n## Payments and deductions\n\nWhen paying your employees through payroll you also need to make deductions for PAYE.\n\n### Payments to your employees\n\n[Payments to your employees](/running-payroll/payments) include their salary or wages, as well as things like any tips or bonuses, or statutory sick or maternity pay.\n\n### Deductions from their pay\n\nFrom these payments, you\u2019ll need to [deduct tax and National Insurance](/running-payroll/deductions) for most employees. Other deductions you may need to make include student loan repayments or pension contributions.\n\n## Reporting to and paying HMRC\n\n### Reporting pay and deductions\n\nIf you run payroll yourself, you\u2019ll need to [report your employees\u2019 payments and deductions](/running-payroll/reporting-to-hmrc) to HMRC on or before each payday.\n\nYour payroll software will work out how much tax and National Insurance you owe, including an employer\u2019s National Insurance contribution on each employee\u2019s earnings above \u00a3175 a week.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to send another report to [claim any reduction](/running-payroll/reporting-to-hmrc-eps) on what you owe HMRC, for example for statutory pay.\n\n### Paying HMRC\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to view what you owe HMRC, based on your reports. You then have to [pay HMRC](/running-payroll/paying-hmrc), usually every month.\n\nIf you\u2019re a small employer that expects to pay less than \u00a31,500 a month, you can arrange to pay quarterly - contact HMRC\u2019s [payment enquiry helpline](/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/employer-paye-payment).\n\n### Other things to report\n\nAs part of your regular reports, you should tell HMRC:\n\n  * when a [new employee joins](/new-employee)\n  * if an employee\u2019s [circumstances change](/running-payroll/reporting-employee-changes), for example they reach State Pension age or become a director\n\n\n\nYou have to run [annual reports](/payroll-annual-reporting/) at the end of the tax year - including telling HMRC about any expenses or benefits.\n\n## Choose how to run payroll\n\nIf you have to operate PAYE, you can [choose how to run your payroll](/paye-for-employers/choose-payroll).\n\n## Choose how to run payroll \n\nYou can [operate PAYE](/paye-for-employers/paye-and-payroll) by either:\n\n  * paying a payroll provider to do it for you\n  * doing it yourself using payroll software\n\n\n\n## Paying a payroll provider\n\nIf you decide to pay a payroll provider (for example, a bureau or accountant) to run your payroll, you\u2019ll need to consider how much support you\u2019ll need.\n\nYou\u2019re responsible for collecting and [keeping records](/paye-for-employers/keeping-records) of your employee\u2019s details. Your payroll provider will need these to run payroll for you.\n\nSome payroll providers can offer you more support if you need it, for example keeping employee records, providing payslips and making payments to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).\n\nAs an employer, you\u2019re legally responsible for completing all PAYE tasks - even if you pay someone else to do them.\n\n## Running payroll yourself\n\nYou need to complete [certain tasks to set up payroll](/paye-for-employers/setting-up-payroll) and pay your employees for the first time. This includes registering as an employer with HMRC and telling them about your employees.\n\n## Exemptions to online reporting\n\nYou may be exempt from reporting payroll online if:\n\n  * you\u2019re prevented from using a computer on religious grounds\n  * you\u2019re getting care or support services for yourself or a member of your family\n  * you\u2019re unable to send reports electronically because you\u2019re disabled, elderly or cannot access the internet\n\n\n\nHMRC has [guidance if you believe you\u2019re exempt](/find-out-which-employers-are-exempt-from-online-payroll-reporting) and would prefer to report on paper.\n\n## Setting up payroll \n\nIf you decide to run payroll yourself, you need to complete certain tasks to pay your employees for the first time. You can choose when and how often to pay your employees.\n\n  1. [Register as an employer](/register-employer) with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and get a login for [PAYE Online](/paye-online).\n\n  2. [Choose payroll software](/payroll-software) to record employee\u2019s details, calculate pay and deductions, and report to HMRC.\n\n  3. [Collect and keep records](/paye-for-employers/keeping-records).\n\n  4. [Tell HMRC about your employees](/new-employee/).\n\n  5. [Record pay, make deductions and report to HMRC](/running-payroll/) on or before the first payday.\n\n  6. [Pay HMRC](/running-payroll/paying-hmrc) the tax and National Insurance you owe.\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll also need to complete certain [annual reports and tasks](/payroll-annual-reporting) to prepare for the next tax year, which starts on 6 April.\n\n## Keeping records \n\nYou must collect and keep records of:\n\n  * [what you pay your employees](/running-payroll/payments) and the [deductions you make](/running-payroll/deductions)\n  * [reports you make](/running-payroll/reporting-to-hmrc) to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)\n  * [payments you make to HMRC](/running-payroll/paying-hmrc)\n  * employee leave and sickness absences\n  * [tax code notices](/employee-tax-codes/changes)\n  * taxable [expenses or benefits](/employer-reporting-expenses-benefits/record-keeping)\n  * [Payroll Giving Scheme](/payroll-giving) documents, including the agency contract and employee authorisation forms\n\n\n\nYour records must show you\u2019ve reported accurately, and you need to keep them for 3 years from the end of the tax year they relate to. [HMRC may check your records](/tax-compliance-checks) to make sure you\u2019re paying the right amount of tax.\n\nThere are different rules for [keeping records to prove you have paid the correct minimum wage](/national-minimum-wage/employers-and-the-minimum-wage).\n\nIf you do not keep full records, HMRC may estimate what you have to pay and charge you a penalty of up to \u00a33,000.\n\n## If your records are lost, stolen or destroyed\n\nTell HMRC as soon as possible if you do not have records and cannot replace them. You must also do your best to recreate them - HMRC may be able to help if you\u2019re not sure how much you paid your employees.\n\nYou must tell HMRC if your [final payroll report](/payroll-annual-reporting/send-your-final-payroll-report) of the tax year includes figures that are:\n\n  * estimated - that you want HMRC to accept as final\n  * provisional - that you\u2019ll update later with actual figures\n\n\n\n## Data protection\n\nYou must follow rules on [data protection](/data-protection-your-business) if your business stores or uses personal information.\n  *[PAYE]: Pay As You Earn\n  *[HMRC]: HM Revenue and Customs",

      "body": "## Choosing schools \n\nIf you live in England contact [your local council](/find-your-local-council) to find:\n\n  * state-funded schools in your area\n  * [admission criteria](/schools-admissions/admissions-criteria) for the schools you\u2019re interested in\n\n\n\nThe process is different if you live in [Scotland](https://www.mygov.scot/register-your-child-for-a-school/), [Wales](https://gov.wales/school-admissions) or [Northern Ireland](https://www.eani.org.uk/parents/admissions).\n\nYou can also contact your local council to apply for places at state schools in other areas. You can search online to find [schools in England](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/).\n\n## Private schools or home schooling\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for [a place at a private school](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school/private-schools) (also called \u2018independent schools\u2019), contact the school directly.\n\nYou can also choose to [teach your child at home](https://www.gov.uk/home-education), known as home schooling.\n\n## Children with an Education, Health and Care (EHC) plan\n\nIf your child has an Education, Health and Care (EHC) plan, it may name a school for them. A school named in the EHC plan must give your child a place.\n\n## Find out about a primary or secondary school\n\nYou can find out more by:\n\n  * visiting the school - most schools have open days\n  * reading the school\u2019s most recent [Ofsted reports](http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report)\n  * checking [school performance tables](http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/performance)\n  * talking to other parents about what they think of the school\n\n\n\n### What schools must publish on their website\n\nSchools\u2019 websites must include:\n\n  * admission arrangements, including how to apply\n  * details of the curriculum\n  * behaviour policy\n  * links to Ofsted reports\n  * links to performance data\n  * the school\u2019s latest key stage 2 and 4 attainment and progress measures\n  * their special educational needs (SEN) information report, which includes information about their policies for children or young people with [special educational needs and disabilities](/children-with-special-educational-needs)\n  * the amount of money they get for taking underprivileged children (the \u2018pupil premium\u2019), what they do with it and the effect it\u2019s had\n\n\n\nYou can also get advice about choosing state-funded schools from your [local council](/find-your-local-council).\n\n## Admission criteria \n\nAll schools have admission criteria to decide which children get places. The school or local council usually set these.\n\nAdmission criteria are different for each school. They may give priority to children:\n\n  * who live close to the school\n  * who have a brother or sister at the school already\n  * from a particular religion (for faith schools)\n  * who pass an entrance exam (for selective schools, for example grammar schools)\n  * who went to a particular primary school (a \u2018feeder school\u2019)\n  * who are eligible for the pupil premium or the service pupil premium\n  * whose parent has worked at the school for 2 years or more\n\n\n\nYour [local council](/find-your-local-council) can give you information about schools\u2019 criteria and how to apply.\n\n## Children in care\n\nAll state-funded schools must give top priority to admitting children who:\n\n  * are in care or being looked after\n  * have been in care\n\n\n\n## Complain about unfair admission arrangements\n\nContact the [Schools Adjudicator](http://www.education.gov.uk/schoolsadjudicator/howwecanhelp/a0076144/how-to-raise-an-objection-to-school-admission-arrangements) if you think a school has unlawful or unfair admission arrangements.\n\nYou need to complain by 15 May of the year before you\u2019re applying for a place. For example, to complain about admission arrangements for September 2021 the deadline is 15 May 2020.\n\n## School starting age \n\nMost children start reception full-time in September after their fourth birthday.\n\nFor example, if your child turns 4 in June, they\u2019ll usually start school in September that same year.\n\n## If you want your child to start later\n\nIf you do not think your child is ready to start school in September, they can start later. For example, if your child only turns 4 in August, you might decide to wait before sending them to school. But they must be in full-time education by the time they reach \u2018compulsory school age\u2019.\n\nThey can start:\n\n  * part time\n  * part-way through the year\n  * in the next school year, in the September after they turn 5\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll still need to [apply for a school place](/schools-admissions/how-to-apply) at the same time as everyone else. You can ask for a later start when you apply.\n\n### If your child starts in the September after they turn 5\n\nYour child will go into [year 1](/national-curriculum). Contact the local council or school if you want your child to start in reception instead. They do not have to agree.\n\n## Compulsory school age\n\nYour child must start full-time education once they reach compulsory school age. This is on 31 December, 31 March or 31 August following their fifth birthday - whichever comes first. If your child\u2019s fifth birthday is on one of those dates then they reach compulsory school age on that date.\n\nFor example, if your child reaches compulsory school age on 31 March, they must start full-time education at the beginning of the next term (summer term that year).\n\nChildren must stay in full-time education until they reach [school leaving age](/know-when-you-can-leave-school).\n\nAll 3 to 4-year-olds in England are entitled to [free early education](/help-with-childcare-costs/free-childcare-and-education-for-2-to-4-year-olds) before they start school full time.\n\n## How to apply \n\nFollow your local council\u2019s application process to:\n\n  * [apply for a primary school place](/apply-for-primary-school-place)\n  * [apply for a secondary school place](/apply-for-secondary-school-place)\n\n\n\nYou must still apply for a place, even if the school is linked to your child\u2019s current nursery, infant or primary school.\n\nApply directly for:\n\n  * a 6th form place at a school or college\n  * a place at a private school\n\n\n\n## Moving to another area\n\nYou apply through your local council even if you\u2019re applying for schools in another council area or you\u2019ve just moved to England.\n\nIf you\u2019re applying from another country, contact the local council in the area where you\u2019re going to live.\n\nYou may need to:\n\n  * supply proof of your new address, for example a mortgage or rental agreement or deeds for the property\n  * prove that you\u2019ll live in the area before the start of the next school term\n\n\n\n## Completing the application\n\nWhen you fill in the form (online or on paper) you\u2019ll be asked to list the schools you\u2019re applying for in order of preference.\n\nListing only one school will not increase your chances of getting a place there.\n\nTo get a copy of the application form on paper, [contact your local council](/find-your-local-council).\n\n## When to apply\n\nApplications open on different days in each local council area.\n\n### Applying for a primary school place\n\nYou must [apply for a primary school place](/apply-for-primary-school-place) a year before your child can start school. The [school starting age](/schools-admissions/school-starting-age) is 4. \n\nYour child will be 3 or have just turned 4 when you apply.\n\nThis is true even if you want your child to start later - you\u2019ll be able to ask for a later start when you apply. \n\nApplications open in September each year and close on 15 January.\n\n### Applying for a secondary school place\n\nApplications usually open on 1 September. You must [apply for a secondary school place](/apply-for-secondary-school-place) by 31 October.\n\nYour child is less likely to be offered a place at their chosen schools if you miss the deadline for applications.\n\n## When you\u2019ll find out\n\nCouncils will send offers of school places for:\n\n  * primary schools on 16 April\n  * secondary schools on 1 March\n\n\n\nIf either date falls on a weekend or a bank holiday, offers are sent the next working day.\n\nYou must accept the offer by the deadline given in the offer letter. Otherwise it may be withdrawn and the place given to someone else.\n\nThe local council must provide a place at another school, if your child is not offered a place at any of the schools you\u2019ve applied for. This is usually your nearest school with places still available.\n\n## Applying after the start of the school year\n\n[Contact your local council](/find-your-local-council) to find out about applying for a school place once the school year has started (known as in-year applications). They can tell you which schools still have places and how to apply.\n\nOnce your child has been offered a place, they will usually start school at the beginning of the following term.\n\n## School waiting lists \n\nIf your child does not have a place, [contact your local council](/find-your-local-council) for schools with places.\n\nYou can also put your child\u2019s name down on a waiting list. The \u2018admission authority\u2019 for the school (usually the school itself or the council) must keep a waiting list open for at least the first term of each school year.\n\nContact the school or your local council if you want your child\u2019s name added to a waiting list.\n\nYou can add your child\u2019s name to a waiting list even if they have been offered a place at another school.\n\nIf your child is on a waiting list and the school offers you a place, the admission authority will send you a formal offer. You can still accept the offer even if your child has already started at another school.\n\n## Appealing a school's decision \n\nYou\u2019ll be sent a letter with the decision about your child\u2019s school. If your child is refused a place, you can appeal against the decision. The letter will tell you how.\n\nYou must appeal against each rejection separately. You can only appeal once against each rejection.\n\n## Preparing your appeal\n\nThe admission authority for the school must allow you at least 20 school days to appeal from when they send the decision letter.\n\nThe admission authority will set a deadline for submitting information and evidence to support your appeal. If you submit anything after the deadline, it might not be considered and may result in delays to your hearing.\n\n[Child Law Advice](https://childlawadvice.org.uk/education/) may be able to give you advice about appeals.\n\n## When the hearing will be\n\nThe admission authority must give you at least 10 school days\u2019 notice of the hearing.\n\nAppeals must be heard within 40 school days of the deadline for making an appeal.\n\n## What happens at the appeal hearing\n\nThere\u2019s a panel of 3 or more people at the appeal hearing. The panel must be independent and must follow the [school admission appeals code](/government/publications/school-admissions-appeals-code).\n\n  1. The admission authority will explain why they turned down your application.\n\n  2. You\u2019ll be able to give your own reasons why your child should be admitted.\n\n  3. The appeals panel must decide if the school\u2019s admission criteria were properly followed and comply with the [school admissions code](/government/publications/school-admissions-code--2).\n\n  4. If the criteria were not properly followed or do not comply with the [school admissions code](/government/publications/school-admissions-code--2) your appeal must be upheld.\n\n  5. If your reasons for your child to be admitted outweigh the school\u2019s reasons for not admitting any more children at all, your appeal will be upheld.\n\n  6. You will usually be sent the decision within 5 school days.\n\n\n\n\nYou can read more about [school admission appeals](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/admission-appeals-for-school-places/advice-for-parents-and-guardians-on-school-admission-appeals).\n\n## Appeals for infant classes\n\nYou need to go through the same process if you\u2019re appealing a decision about an infant class. In reception, year 1 and year 2, the class size is limited to 30. Your application can be turned down if all the classes already have 30 children.\n\nYour appeal could be successful if:\n\n  * giving your child a place will not increase the class size above the limit\n  * the admission arrangements have not been properly followed\n  * the admission criteria do not comply with the [school admissions code](/government/publications/school-admissions-code--2)\n\n## Complain about the appeals process \n\nYou can complain about the way the appeal was carried out, but you can not complain about the decision itself.\n\n## Maintained schools\n\nComplain to the Local Government Ombudsman.\n\n[Fill in the online complaint form](http://www.lgo.org.uk/forms/ShowForm.asp?fm_fid=62).\n\n### If a maintained school becomes an academy\n\nIf you complain about an appeal concerning a maintained school that then converts to academy status, the Local Government Ombudsman will investigate it and pass any actions to the Department for Education (DfE).\n\n## Other schools\n\n[Fill in the academy appeal panel complaint form](https://form.education.gov.uk/en/AchieveForms/?form_uri=sandbox-publish://AF-Process-323aa8b0-fc15-4df9-ae7f-1404d6466120/AF-Stage-c3cd8ecf-ea18-47de-b9e6-f037503d2804/definition.json&redirectlink=/en&cancelRedirectLink=/en&noLoginPrompt=1) to complain about an appeal made to:\n\n  * free schools\n  * academies, including university technical colleges and studio schools\n\n\n\nUsing the online form is the quickest way to make a complaint. If you need a paper form instead, contact:\n\nDepartment for Education helpline  \nTelephone: 0370 000 2288   \nMonday to Friday, 9:30am to 5pm   \n[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)\n\nYou should get a decision on your complaint within 9 weeks (45 working days). You\u2019ll be told if it\u2019ll take longer.\n\nYou\u2019ll get a letter explaining the reasons for the decision.\n\nIf DfE decides something went wrong with the appeals panel, it may:\n\n  * ask the school to hold a new appeal hearing with a different panel\n  * recommend the school reviews its appeals process\n\n\n\n## Complain about another school matter\n\nIf you have a complaint about a school that is not related to the appeals process, [contact the Department for Education](https://form.education.gov.uk/service/Contact_the_Department_for_Education).\n  *[EHC]: education, health and care\n  *[SEN]: special educational needs\n  *[DfE]: Department for Education",

higher education course before\n  * your age \n  * your nationality or residency status\n\n\n\n## Your university or college\n\nThis should be a university, college or other institution that offers a [qualifying course](https://www.gov.uk/check-a-university-is-officially-recognised).\n\n## Your course\n\nCheck with your university or college if you\u2019re not sure whether your course qualifies for funding.\n\n### If you\u2019re studying full-time\n\nYou may be eligible for student finance if your course is in the UK and one of the following:\n\n  * a first degree, for example BA, BSc or BEd\n  * a Foundation Degree\n  * a Certificate of Higher Education\n  * a Diploma of Higher Education (DipHE)\n  * a Higher National Certificate (HNC)\n  * a Higher National Diploma (HND)\n  * an Initial Teacher Training course\n  * an integrated master\u2019s degree\n  * a pre-registration postgraduate healthcare course\n  * a level 4 or 5 course with Higher Technical Qualification approval\n\n\n\n### If you\u2019re studying part-time\n\nYour course [needs a \u2018course intensity\u2019 of 25% or more](/student-finance/parttime-students) for you to be eligible for student finance.\n\nYou may be eligible for a Tuition Fee Loan if your course is in the UK and one of the following:\n\n  * a first degree, for example BA, BSc or BEd\n  * a Foundation Degree\n  * a Certificate of Higher Education\n  * a Diploma of Higher Education (DipHE)\n  * a Higher National Certificate (HNC)\n  * a Higher National Diploma (HND)\n  * an Initial Teacher Training course\n  * an

Degree in dental hygiene and dental therapy\n  * a DipHE in dental hygiene and dental therapy or operating department practice\n  * a level 4 or 5 course with Higher Technical Qualification approval\n\n\n\nYou are not eligible for student finance if you\u2019re doing a degree apprenticeship.\n\n## If you\u2019ve studied before\n\nYou\u2019ll usually only get student finance if you\u2019re doing your first higher education qualification - even if your previous course was self-funded. You may still be eligible for limited funding in certain circumstances and for some courses.\n\n### If you changed course, stopped your studies or are repeating a year\n\nIf you stopped your course within the first year, you\u2019ll get funding for the same course or a new course when you go back.\n\nYou might also get funding if you:\n\n  * suspended your course or withdrew before it finished - and you\u2019re going back to study any course\n  * are repeating a year of your course at the same university, college, or institution.\n\n\n\nIf you [stopped your studies for a personal reason](/student-finance-if-you-suspend-or-leave/getting-student-finance-while-you-suspend-your-studies) (for example, you were ill or pregnant) you might get funding for all of your course - you should [apply online with supporting evidence](/apply-for-student-finance). \n\n#### How to work out what funding you\u2019ll get\n\nIf you\u2019re eligible for Maintenance Loans or Grants, you should get them for every year of your new course.\n\nAny Tuition Fee Loans you\u2019re eligible for will be applied to the final years of your new course. You can calculate how many years you\u2019ll get them for by taking the total number of years you\u2019re applying for and adding one year. Then, take away the number of years you studied for previously. If you studied for part of a year, you should count it as a whole year.\n\n### Example\n\nIf you\u2019re applying for a 3 year course and have studied 2 years of a different course, you\u2019ll get a Maintenance Loan in year 1 and Tuition Fees and Maintenance Loans in years 2 and 3.\n\nIf you\u2019ve already completed a 3 year course but didn\u2019t gain a qualification and want to apply for another 3 year course, you\u2019ll get Maintenance Loans in years 1 and 2. You\u2019ll get Tuition Fees and Maintenance Loans in year 3.\n\n### If you already have a degree\n\nYou may be eligible for limited funding in certain circumstances.\n\nYou may get limited funding if you\u2019re \u2018topping up\u2019 a higher education qualification, for example you\u2019ve finished an HNC, HND or Foundation Degree and now want to do an Honours degree.\n\nYou may also get limited funding if you hold an Honours degree or a higher level of qualification and start a new course. This could be a part-time Honours degree, a joint Honours degree or an Integrated Master\u2019s degree in one of the following (or 2 if it\u2019s a joint Honours degree):\n\n  * agriculture and related subjects\n  * architecture (if it\u2019s a MArch RIBA Part 2 course)\n  * biological sciences\n  * computer science\n  * mathematical sciences\n  * medicine and allied subjects\n  * physical sciences\n  * technologies\n  * courses leading to qualification as a veterinary surgeon\n\n\n\nYou could also be eligible if you\u2019re starting a healthcare course on or after 1 August 2017.\n\n## Your age\n\nThere\u2019s no upper age limit for Tuition Fee Loans or grants. \n\n### If you\u2019re 60 or over\n\nYou may get limited funding for Maintenance Loans if all of the following apply:\n\n  * you\u2019re 60 or over on the first day of the first academic year of your \n\n\n\ncourse \n\n  * you\u2019re studying full-time\n  * your course started on or after 1 August 2016\n\n\n\nThe amount you can apply for depends on your household income.\n\n## Your nationality or residency status\n\nYou may be able to get help with: \n\n  * your tuition fees and living costs (full support)\n  * tuition fees (tuition fee-only funding) \n\n\n\nThe type of help you can get depends on your nationality and residency status.\n\n### If you\u2019re a UK national or Irish citizen or have \u2018settled status\u2019 in the UK\n\nYou can apply for full support if you meet the university, course and age requirements. Both of the following must also apply:\n\n  * your home is in England\n  * you\u2019ve been continuously living in the UK, Channel Islands or Isle of Man for 3 years before the [first day of your first academic year](/guidance/understanding-academic-years) (apart from temporary absences such as holidays)\n\n\n\n### If you have a different nationality or you live outside the UK\n\nUse the [undergraduate student finance checker](/check-what-undergraduate-student-finance-you-can-apply-for-depending-on-your-nationality-and-residency) to find out the type of help you can get depending on your nationality and residency status. It will tell you:\n\n  * if you can apply\n  * what type of loan you can apply for\n\n## Apply \n\nFind out [how to apply](/apply-for-student-finance) for student finance.\n\n## Parents or partners of students\n\n[Confirm your income](/support-child-or-partners-student-finance-application) if you\u2019re the student\u2019s parent or partner.\n  *[SLC]: Student Loans Company\n  *[DipHE]: Diploma of Higher Education\n  *[HNC]: Higher National Certificate\n  *[HND]: Higher National Diploma",

Your education or training provider decides how much you get and what it\u2019s used for.\n\nIf you\u2019re over 19, you\u2019ll only be eligible for a discretionary bursary.\n\nYour provider will decide how you get your bursary.

Ask student services or your tutor to explain what you need to do.\n\n## When to apply\n\nApply once you know where you\u2019ll study or train, so you\u2019ll get your bursary as soon as possible.\n\nYou might need to reapply for a bursary for each year of your course.

Follow their complaints process if you cannot resolve the problem.\n\n## Emergencies and hardship\n\nYou might be able to get more support if your circumstances change or you have an emergency. Your provider might also have a separate hardship fund.

      "body": "## Overview \n\nApprentices are aged 16 or over and combine working with studying to gain skills and knowledge in a specific job.\n\nThis guidance is for employers in England. There\u2019s a different way to employ an:\n\n  * [apprentice in Scotland](http://www.apprenticeship.scot/)\n  * [apprentice in Wales](https://businesswales.gov.wales/skillsgateway/apprenticeships)\n  * [apprentice in Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/campaigns/apprenticeships)\n\n\n\nApprentices can be new or current employees.\n\nYou must pay the apprentice at least [the minimum wage](/national-minimum-wage-rates).\n\nApprenticeships must last at least a year. They can last up to 5 years depending on the level the apprentice is studying.\n\n## Your responsibilities\n\nYou\u2019re responsible for making sure your apprentice:\n\n  * works with experienced staff\n  * learns job-specific skills\n  * gets time off during their working week for apprenticeship training\n\n\n\n## Hiring an apprentice\n\nThere are several steps to taking on an apprentice.\n\n  1. [Choose an apprenticeship](https://findapprenticeshiptraining.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/) for your business or organisation.\n\n  2. [Find an organisation that offers training](https://findapprenticeshiptraining.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/) for the apprenticeship you\u2019ve chosen.\n\n  3. Check what [training funding you can get](/take-on-an-apprentice/get-funding).\n\n  4. [Create an account](/employing-an-apprentice/create-an-account) \\- you need this to manage funding and recruit apprentices.\n\n  5. Advertise your apprenticeship - [find out how to create an advert](/guidance/creating-an-apprenticeship-advert) or give your training provider permission to do this for you.\n\n  6. [Make an apprenticeship agreement and training plan](/employing-an-apprentice/apprenticeship-agreement) with your chosen apprentice.\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not want to hire and train the apprentice yourself, you can use a [flexi-job apprenticeship agency](/government/publications/register-of-flexi-job-apprenticeship-agencies). The apprentice will be employed by the agency but will work in your organisation.\n\n## Get funding for apprenticeship training \n\nYou can get help from the government to pay for apprenticeship training.\n\nYou might be able to get an additional payment of \u00a31,000, depending on the apprentice you hire.\n\n## What funding you can get\n\nYou can get money to go towards the cost of training and assessment. The amount you get depends on whether you pay the apprenticeship levy or not.\n\nFind out if you need to [pay the apprenticeship levy](/guidance/pay-apprenticeship-levy).\n\n### If you do not pay the apprenticeship levy\n\nYou pay 5% towards the cost of training and assessing your apprentice. You need to:\n\n  * agree a payment schedule with the training provider\n  * pay them directly for the training\n\n\n\nThe government will pay the rest (95%) up to the [funding band maximum](/government/publications/apprenticeship-funding/apprenticeship-funding). They\u2019ll pay it directly to the training provider.\n\nIf your apprentice started before 1 April 2019, you contribute 10% towards the cost of training and assessing your apprentice and the government pays the rest (90%). This rate continues until your apprentice completes their training.\n\nUse your [apprenticeships service account](/employing-an-apprentice/create-an-account) to manage funding and provider payments.\n\nThe cost of training and assessing your apprentice could be fully funded, up to the funding band maximum, depending on both your and your apprentice\u2019s circumstances. [Check the funding rules](/guidance/apprenticeship-funding-rules) to see if you\u2019re eligible.\n\n### If you pay the apprenticeship levy\n\nYou\u2019ll get funds to spend on training and assessing your apprentices. The government will add 10%.\n\nFind out how to [pay the apprenticeship levy](/guidance/pay-apprenticeship-levy).\n\nUse your [apprenticeships service account](/employing-an-apprentice/create-an-account) to manage funding and provider payments.\n\nYou cannot use funds from your apprenticeship service account to pay for a flexi-job apprenticeship agency\u2019s services.\n\n## Help to pay for other costs\n\nYou can get \u00a31,000 to support your apprentice in the workplace if, at the start of their apprenticeship training, they are one of the following:\n\n  * 16 to 18 years old (or 15 years old if the apprentice\u2019s 16th birthday is between the last Friday of June and 31 August)\n\n  * 19 to 24 years old with an education, health and care (EHC) plan \n\n  * 19 to 24 years old and have been in care\n\n\n\n\nYou can spend it on any costs related to their employment, for example their salary, travel costs or uniform.\n\n### How and when you\u2019ll be paid\n\nThe training provider will pay you once they\u2019ve confirmed that an apprentice is eligible. You\u2019ll be paid in 2 instalments of \u00a3500.\n\nYou\u2019ll get the first payment 90 days after the apprenticeship started and the second payment one year after the apprenticeship started. (Training providers must pay you within 30 working days of receiving the money from the government.)\n\nYou\u2019ll only get paid if the apprentice is still employed by you when the payment is due.\n\nIf an apprentice has an education, health and care (EHC) plan or has been in care, the training provider must get the apprentice\u2019s agreement before sharing this information with you. The training provider will also need this agreement before making any payments to you.\n\n## Create an account \n\nYou need to create an apprenticeships service account. You\u2019ll use this service to:\n\n  * advertise apprenticeships\n  * accept employer agreements with the Department for Education (DfE)\n  * give account access to people within your organisation\n  * set permissions for training providers to allow them to do some things on your behalf (such as advertising apprenticeships)\n\n\n\nYou can also use this service to add details about:\n\n  * your organisation(s) or company\n  * your PAYE scheme\n  * your apprentices\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll need a GOV.UK One Login to set up or access an account. You can create one in the service using a work email address.\n\n[ Start now ](https://accounts.manage-apprenticeships.service.gov.uk/service)\n\n## Before you start\n\nYou\u2019ll need either your organisation\u2019s:\n\n  * Government Gateway username and ID number\n  * PAYE scheme reference number and Accounts Office Reference Number (AORN)\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll also need to provide your:\n\n  * Companies House number, charity number or public body name\n  * email address\n  * PAYE scheme details\n\n## Make an apprenticeship agreement \n\nYou must sign an apprenticeship agreement with your apprentice.\n\nThis gives details of:\n\n  * the skill, trade or occupation the apprentice is being trained for\n  * the name of the apprenticeship they\u2019re working towards\n  * the start and end dates for the apprenticeship\n  * the amount of training you\u2019ll give them\n\n\n\nYou can write your own apprentice agreement or [download an apprenticeship agreement template](/government/publications/apprenticeship-agreement-template).\n\n## Training plan\n\nYou must sign a training plan with your apprentice and the training provider.\n\nYou can write your own plan or use the [apprenticeship training plan template](/government/publications/apprenticeships-off-the-job-training).\n\nIt must include:\n\n  * the planned content and schedule for training\n  * what is expected and offered by the employer, the training provider and the apprentice\n  * how to resolve queries or complaints\n\n\n\n## If the apprentice has relevant experience\n\nYour apprentice could spend less time training or qualify earlier if they have relevant experience. The training provider will tell you which it will be, depending on how the training is delivered.\n\nRelevant experience includes having:\n\n  * qualifications, such as a National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) in a relevant subject\n  * industry or sector experience\n  * completed training, such as an IT course\n\n\n\nIf the amount of training is reduced, you must agree this with both the training provider and the apprentice during [the initial assessment](https://www.apprenticeships.gov.uk/employers/prepare-for-the-initial-assessment).\n\n## Pay and conditions for apprentices \n\nYou are responsible for:\n\n  * giving your apprentice their contract of employment\n  * paying your apprentice\u2019s wage\n  * signing an [apprenticeship agreement](/employing-an-apprentice/apprenticeship-agreement)\n\n\n\n## Pay for apprentices\n\nYou must pay apprentices at least the [National Minimum Wage](/national-minimum-wage/employers-and-the-minimum-wage).\n\nThere are different rates of pay for apprentices depending on their age and what year of their apprenticeship they\u2019ve completed.\n\nThe contract of employment should make it clear what wage you\u2019ll pay your apprentice and for what hours.\n\n### Aged 16 to 18\n\nThe current [National Minimum Wage](/national-minimum-wage-rates) rate for an apprentice is \u00a36.40 per hour.\n\n### Aged 19 or over and in their first year\n\nThe current [National Minimum Wage](/national-minimum-wage-rates) rate for an apprentice is \u00a36.40 per hour.\n\n### Aged 19 or over and have completed their first year\n\nApprentices will be entitled to the [National Minimum Wage or National Living Wage rate](/national-minimum-wage-rates) for their age.\n\nUse the [National Minimum Wage and Living Wage calculator](https://www.gov.uk/am-i-getting-minimum-wage) to check if you\u2019re paying your apprentices correctly.\n\n## Conditions\n\nApprentices must work towards an [approved apprenticeship](https://findapprenticeshiptraining.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/). Their training must last at least 12 months.\n\nThey must be employed in a real job that gives them the opportunity to gain the knowledge and skills they need to pass their assessment.\n\n### Training and study\n\nYou must pay your apprentice for time spent training or studying for their apprenticeship.\n\nApprentices must get time off during their working week for apprenticeship training.\n\nThe training might take place:\n\n  * at their place of work\n  * somewhere else (for example, a college or training provider)\n  * online\n\n\n\nIf your apprentice is also studying for English or maths qualifications required by their apprenticeship, they are entitled to paid study time during their normal working hours.\n\n### Employee rights\n\nYou must offer apprentices the same conditions as other employees working at similar grades or in similar roles. This includes:\n\n  * paid holidays\n  * sick pay\n  * any benefits you offer such as childcare voucher schemes\n  * any support you offer such as coaching or mentoring\n\n\n\n## Apprentices and redundancy\n\nApprentices have the same employment rights as your other employees. Follow the process for [making staff redundant](/staff-redundant) if you have to make an apprentice redundant.\n\n[Get legal advice](/find-a-legal-adviser) if you want to end the apprenticeship early for another reason.\n\n### Support for apprentices\n\nYour apprentice can get support if they\u2019re being made redundant or are at risk of redundancy.\n\nThey can get:\n\n  * financial and legal advice\n  * support for their health and wellbeing\n  * help finding another apprenticeship\n\n\n\nDfE Apprenticeships and Skills Helpline  \nTelephone: 0800 015 0400  \nMonday to Friday, 9am to 5pm\n\n## Get help employing an apprentice \n\nYou can get more information on the [employer support site](https://help.employersupport.apprenticeships.gov.uk/hc/en-gb).\n\nIf you still need help, contact the employer support service.\n\nEmployer support service   \nTelephone: 0800 015 0400  \nMonday to Friday, 9am to 5pm  \n[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)",

      "body": "## Entitlement \n\nEmployees may be [eligible for Statutory Paternity Leave and Pay](/employers-paternity-pay-leave/eligibility) if they and their partner are:\n\n  * having a baby\n  * adopting a child\n  * having a baby through a surrogacy arrangement\n\n\n\nThis guide is also available [in Welsh (Cymraeg)](/cyflogwyr-tal-absenoldeb-tadolaeth).\n\n## Statutory Paternity Leave\n\n### If the baby is due before or on 6 April 2024, or before 6 April 2024 for adoptions\n\nEmployees can choose to take either 1 week or 2 consecutive weeks\u2019 leave. The amount of time is the same even if they have more than one child (for example twins).\n\nLeave cannot start before the birth. The start date must be one of the following:\n\n  * the actual date of birth\n  * an agreed number of days after the birth\n  * an agreed number of days after the expected week of childbirth\n\n\n\nLeave must finish within 56 days of the birth (or due date, if the baby is early).\n\nThe start and end dates are different [if the employee is adopting](/employers-paternity-pay-leave/adoption).\n\n### If the baby is due after 6 April 2024, or on or after 6 April 2024 for adoptions\n\nEmployees can take either 1 or 2 weeks\u2019 leave. If the employee is taking 2 weeks they can either be taken consecutively or separately. The amount of time is the same even if they have more than one child (for example twins).\n\nLeave cannot start before the birth. The start date must be one of the following:\n\n  * the actual date of birth\n  * a specified number of days after the birth \n  * a set date which is after the date of birth\n\n\n\nLeave must finish within 52 weeks of the birth (or due date, if the baby is early).\n\nThe start and end dates are different [if the employee is adopting](/employers-paternity-pay-leave/adoption).\n\nThere are different rules [if you\u2019re in Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/paternity-leave).\n\n## Statutory Paternity Pay\n\nStatutory Paternity Pay for eligible employees is either \u00a3184.03 a week or 90% of their average weekly earnings (whichever is lower). Tax and National Insurance need to be deducted.\n\nCalculate an employee\u2019s paternity leave and pay using the [maternity and paternity calculator](/maternity-paternity-calculator).\n\nSome employment types, like agency workers, directors and educational workers, have [different rules for entitlement](/statutory-paternity-pay-employment-types-that-affect-payment).\n\n## Extra leave or pay\n\nEmployees can get more leave or pay if:\n\n  * their partner returns to work and they qualify for [Shared Parental Leave and Pay](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay-employer-guide)\n  * your company scheme offers more\n\n\n\nYou must make sure your paternity leave and pay policies are clear and easily accessible to staff.\n\n## Reclaiming payments\n\nEven if you pay an employee more than the statutory amount, you can usually only reclaim 92% of that amount. You may be able to reclaim 103% if you qualify for Small Employers\u2019 Relief. Read more about [reclaiming statutory pay](/recover-statutory-payments).\n\n## Leave for antenatal appointments\n\nEmployees can take unpaid leave to [accompany a pregnant woman to antenatal appointments](/paternity-pay-leave/leave) if they are:\n\n  * the baby\u2019s father\n  * the expectant mother\u2019s spouse or civil partner\n  * in a long term relationship with the expectant mother\n  * the intended parent (if they\u2019re having a baby through a surrogacy arrangement)\n\n\n\nThey can accompany the woman to 2 appointments of up to 6 and a half hours each.\n\n## If the baby dies\n\nEmployees still qualify for paternity leave and pay if the baby is either:\n\n  * stillborn from 24 weeks of pregnancy\n  * born alive at any point in the pregnancy but later dies\n\n\n\n## Employment rights\n\nAn employee\u2019s [employment rights](/employee-rights-when-on-leave) (like the right to pay, holidays and returning to a job) are protected during paternity leave. You still have to pay Statutory Paternity Pay even if you stop trading.\n\n## Eligibility \n\nEmployees must be one of the following, the:\n\n  * father\n  * husband or partner of the mother (or adopter)\n  * child\u2019s adopter\n  * intended parent (if they\u2019re having a baby through a surrogacy arrangement)\n\n\n\nEmployees must also:\n\n  * be [classed as an employee](/employment-status) (paternity leave only)\n  * be employed by you up to the date the child is born (or placed with the adopter) (paternity pay only)\n  * be on your payroll and earn at least \u00a3123 a week (gross) in an 8 week \u2018relevant period\u2019 (paternity pay only)\n  * give you the [correct notice](/paternity-leave-pay-employees/notice-period)\n  * be taking time off to look after the child or their partner\n  * be responsible for the child\u2019s upbringing\n  * have been [continuously employed by you](/continuous-employment-what-it-is) for at least 26 weeks up to any day in the \u2018qualifying week\u2019\n\n\n\nThe qualifying week is the 15th week before the baby is due. This is different [if the employee is adopting](/paternity-leave-pay-employees/adoption).\n\nUse the [paternity pay calculator](/maternity-paternity-calculator) to check an employee\u2019s eligibility and work out their relevant period, notice period and paternity pay.\n\nThere are [special rules](/statutory-paternity-pay-employee-circumstances-that-affect-payment) for some employee situations, for example if they leave or become sick.\n\n## If the child is born early\n\nIf the child is born early, the employee is still eligible if they would have worked for you continuously for at least 26 weeks by the qualifying week.\n\n## Employees in surrogacy arrangements\n\nParents intending to have a child through a surrogacy arrangement may be eligible for Statutory Paternity Pay and Leave.\n\nIf you ask, they must give you a written statement to confirm that they\u2019ve applied or intend to apply for a [parental order](/become-a-childs-legal-parent) in the 6 months after the baby\u2019s birth.\n\n## Notice period \n\nThe notice periods and forms are different [if the employee is adopting](/paternity-leave-pay-employees/adoption).\n\n## Statutory Paternity Leave\n\nFor babies expected before or on 6 April 2024, employees must tell you at least 15 weeks before the baby is expected:\n\n  * the due date\n  * when they want their leave to start\n  * how much leave they want\n\n\n\nFor babies expected after 6 April 2024, employees must tell you the due date at least 15 weeks before the baby is expected. They must tell you when they want their leave to start, and how much leave they want to take, at least 28 days before.\n\nNotice does not have to be in writing unless you request it.\n\nEmployees can ask for leave and pay in writing using [the online form](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/fill-online/apply-for-statutory-paternity-pay). This replaces form SC3. Employees will need to download or print the form after completing it and give you a copy.\n\n## Statutory Paternity Pay\n\nEmployees must claim paternity pay at least 15 weeks before the week the baby is expected.\n\nNotice does not have to be in writing unless you request it.\n\nEmployees can ask for leave and pay in writing using [the online form](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/fill-online/apply-for-statutory-paternity-pay). Employees will need to download or print the form after completing it and give you a copy.\n\nEmployees having a baby through a surrogacy arrangement can use [form SC4](/government/publications/ordinary-statutory-paternity-pay-and-leave-becoming-an-adoptive-parent-sc4) to request leave and pay.\n\n## Late notice\n\nYou can delay the leave or pay start date if the employee does not have a reasonable excuse for giving you the wrong amount of notice. To delay it, write to them within 28 days of their leave request.\n\n## Adoption \n\nEligible employees are [entitled to paternity leave and pay](/paternity-leave-pay-employees/entitlement) if they\u2019re adopting a child.\n\nCalculate an employee\u2019s paternity leave and pay using the [maternity and paternity calculator](/maternity-paternity-calculator). For overseas adoptions you\u2019ll need to use your payroll software (if it has this feature) or [work it out manually](/statutory-paternity-pay-manually-calculate-your-employees-payments).\n\n## Eligibility\n\nAn employee adopting a child must:\n\n  * have been [continuously employed by you](/continuous-employment-what-it-is) for at least 26 weeks up to any day in the week they were matched with a child (UK adoptions)\n  * have been continuously employed by you for at least 26 weeks by either the date the child arrives in the UK or when they want their pay to start (overseas adoptions)\n  * confirm that their partner is getting Statutory Adoption Pay in writing or by giving you a copy of their partner\u2019s [form SC6](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statutory-adoption-pay-and-leave-adopting-a-child-from-abroad-sc6)\n  * meet the other [eligibility conditions](/paternity-leave-pay-employees/eligibility) for paternity leave or pay\n\n\n\n## Notice period\n\nAn employee adopting a child can send you [form SC4](/government/publications/ordinary-statutory-paternity-pay-and-leave-becoming-an-adoptive-parent-sc4) (or your own version) for:\n\n  * leave - no later than 7 days of their co-adopter or partner being matched with a child\n  * pay - 28 days, or as soon as they\u2019re reasonably able, before they want their pay to start\n\n\n\nFor overseas adoptions the form and notice period is different. The process is explained on [form SC5](/government/publications/ordinary-statutory-paternity-pay-and-leave-adopting-a-child-from-abroad-sc5).\n\n## Leave start date\n\nAn employee taking paternity leave because they\u2019re adopting can start their leave:\n\n  * on the date of placement\n  * an agreed number of days after the date of placement\n  * on the date the child arrives in the UK or an agreed number of days after this (overseas adoptions)\n\n\n\nLeave must be taken within:\n\n  * 56 days of the date of placement or the child\u2019s arrival in the UK (for overseas adoptions) - for children who are placed or arrive before 6 April 2024\n  * 52 weeks of the date of placement or arrival - for children who are placed or arrive on or after 6 April 2024\n\n\n\n## Proof of adoption\n\nEmployees must give you proof of adoption to qualify for paternity pay. Proof is not needed for paternity leave unless you request it. Proof can be a letter from their adoption agency or their matching certificate.\n\nYou must [keep records](/employers-paternity-pay-leave/records) of the proof.\n\n## Refuse pay form SPP1 \n\nYou can refuse Statutory Paternity Pay if the employee does not qualify. To do this send them [form SPP1](/government/publications/ordinary-statutory-paternity-pay-non-payment-explanation-ospp1) within 28 days of their pay request. You must keep a copy.\n\nThe employee can ask you for a written statement explaining your decision. You have to give this to them within a reasonable time, for example 7 working days.\n\n## Record keeping \n\nYou must keep records for HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), including:\n\n  * the date Statutory Paternity Pay started\n  * the paternity payments you\u2019ve made (including dates)\n  * the [payments you\u2019ve reclaimed](/recover-statutory-payments)\n  * any weeks you did not pay and why\n  * if adopting, a letter from the adoption agency or a matching certificate\n\n\n\nYou must keep records for 3 years from the end of the tax year they relate to (for example by using [form SPP2](/government/publications/statutory-paternity-pay-record-sheet-spp2) or keeping your own records).\n\n## Help with statutory pay \n\nFor [financial help with statutory pay](/recover-statutory-payments), you can:\n\n  * reclaim payments (usually 92%)\n  * apply for an advance if you cannot afford payments\n\n\n  *[HMRC]: HM Revenue and Customs",

This includes your right to:\n\n  * pay rises\n  * build up (accrue) holiday\n  * return to work\n\n## Leave \n\nStatutory Maternity Leave is 52 weeks. It\u2019s made up of:\n\n  * Ordinary Maternity Leave - first 26 weeks\n  * Additional Maternity Leave - last 26 weeks\n\n\n\nYou do not have to take 52 weeks but you must take 2 weeks\u2019 leave after your baby is born (or 4 weeks if you work in a factory).\n\nUse the [maternity planner](/pay-leave-for-parents) to work out the dates for your ordinary and additional leave.\n\nYou may be entitled to take some of your leave as [Shared Parental Leave](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay).\n\n## Start date and early births\n\nUsually, the earliest you can start your leave is 11 weeks before the expected week of childbirth.\n\nLeave will also start:\n\n  * the day after the birth if the baby is early\n  * automatically if you\u2019re off work for a pregnancy-related illness in the 4 weeks before the week (Sunday to Saturday) that your baby is due\n\n\n\nUse the [maternity planner](/pay-leave-for-parents) to work out the earliest date your maternity leave can start.\n\n## Change your date for returning to work\n\nYou must give your employer at least 8 weeks\u2019 notice if you want to change your return to work date.\n\n## Pay \n\nStatutory Maternity Pay (SMP) is paid for up to 39 weeks. You get:\n\n  * 90% of your average weekly earnings (before tax) for the first 6 weeks\n  * \u00a3184.03 or 90% of your average weekly earnings (whichever is lower) for the next 33 weeks\n\n\n\nSMP is paid in the same way as your wages (for example monthly or weekly). Tax and National Insurance will be deducted.\n\nUse the [maternity pay calculator](/pay-leave-for-parents) to work out how much you could get.\n\nIf you take [Shared Parental Leave](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay) you\u2019ll get Statutory Shared Parental Pay (ShPP). ShPP is \u00a3184.03 a week or 90% of your average weekly earnings, whichever is lower.\n\n## Start date\n\nSMP usually starts when you take your maternity leave.\n\nIt starts automatically if you\u2019re off work for a pregnancy-related illness in the 4 weeks before the week (Sunday to Saturday) that your baby is due.\n\n## Problems and disputes\n\nAsk your employer to explain your SMP if you think it\u2019s not right. If you disagree about the amount or your employer cannot pay (for example because they\u2019re insolvent), [contact the Statutory Payment Disputes Team](/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/statutory-payment-dispute-team).\n\n## Eligibility \n\n## Statutory Maternity Leave\n\nYou qualify for Statutory Maternity Leave if:\n\n  * you\u2019re an [employee not a \u2018worker\u2019](/employment-status)\n  * you give your employer the [correct notice](/maternity-pay-leave/how-to-claim)\n\n\n\nIt does not matter how long you\u2019ve been with your employer, how many hours you work or how much you get paid.\n\nYou cannot get Statutory Maternity Leave if you have a child through surrogacy - you could get [Statutory Adoption Leave and Pay](/adoption-pay-leave) instead.\n\n## Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP)\n\nTo qualify for SMP you must:\n\n  * earn on average at least \u00a3123 a week\n  * give the [correct notice and proof you\u2019re pregnant](/maternity-pay-leave/how-to-claim)\n  * have [worked for your employer continuously](/continuous-employment-what-it-is) for at least 26 weeks continuing into the \u2018qualifying week\u2019 - the 15th week before the expected week of childbirth\n\n\n\nYou cannot get SMP if you go into police custody during your maternity pay period. It will not restart when you\u2019re discharged.\n\n## Early births or you lose your baby\n\nYou can still get Statutory Maternity Leave and SMP if your baby:\n\n  * is born early\n  * is stillborn after the start of your 24th week of pregnancy\n  * dies after being born\n\n\n\n## If you\u2019re not eligible for SMP\n\nYour employer must give you form SMP1 explaining why you cannot get SMP within 7 days of making their decision. You may be eligible for [Maternity Allowance](/maternity-allowance) instead.\n\n[Download form SMP1 - \u2018Statutory Maternity Pay\u2019](/government/publications/statutory-maternity-pay-employee-not-entitled-form-for-employers)\n\n## How to claim \n\n## Statutory Maternity Leave\n\nAt least 15 weeks before your due date, tell your employer when the baby is due and when you want to start your maternity leave. Your employer can ask for this in writing.\n\nYour employer must write to you within 28 days confirming your start and end dates.\n\nUse the [maternity planner](/pay-leave-for-parents) to work out when you must claim your maternity leave.\n\n## Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP)\n\nTell your employer you want to stop work to have a baby and the day you want your SMP to start. You must give them at least 28 days\u2019 notice (in writing if they ask for it) and proof that you\u2019re pregnant.\n\nYour employer must confirm within 28 days how much SMP you\u2019ll get and when it will start and stop.\n\nIf they decide you\u2019re not eligible, they must give you form SMP1 within 7 days of making their decision and explain why.\n\n## Proof you\u2019re pregnant\n\nYou need to give your employer proof of the pregnancy to get SMP. You do not need it for maternity leave.\n\nWithin 21 days of your SMP start date (or as soon as possible if the baby\u2019s born early) give your employer either:\n\n  * a letter from your doctor or midwife\n  * your MATB1 certificate - doctors and midwives will give you this no more than 20 weeks before the due date\n\n\n\nYou will not get SMP if you do not give your employer proof that the baby is due.\n\n## Extra help \n\n## Maternity benefits\n\nUse a [benefits calculator](/benefits-calculators) to see what help you can get from:\n\n  * Universal Credit\n  * Child Benefit\n  * Child Tax Credit\n  * Working Tax Credit - this can continue for 39 weeks after you go on maternity leave\n  * Income Support - you may get this while you\u2019re not working\n\n\n\nYou could get a \u00a3500 [Sure Start Maternity Grant](/sure-start-maternity-grant) (usually if it\u2019s your first child).\n\nIf you\u2019re not eligible for Statutory Maternity Pay, you could get [Maternity Allowance](/maternity-allowance) from the government.\n\n## Company maternity schemes\n\nYou might get more than the statutory amount of leave and pay if your employer has a company maternity scheme. They cannot offer you less than the statutory amount.\n\n## Extra leave\n\nYou could get 18 weeks\u2019 [unpaid parental leave](/parental-leave) after the birth - this may be restricted to 4 weeks per year.\n  *[SMP]: Statutory Maternity Pay",

This includes your right to:\n\n  * pay rises\n  * build up (accrue) holiday\n  * return to work\n\n\n\nYou can get time off to accompany your partner (or the surrogate mother) to 2 antenatal appointments.\n\nIf you\u2019re adopting a child, you can get time off to attend 2 adoption appointments after you\u2019ve been matched with a child.\n\n## Leave \n\n## Paternity leave\n\nThe amount of leave you can take depends on when your baby is due.\n\n### If the baby is due before or on 6 April 2024, or before 6 April 2024 for adoptions\n\nYou can choose to take either 1 or 2 weeks\u2019 leave. You must take your leave in one go. You get the same amount of leave even if you have more than one child (for example, twins).\n\nA week of leave is the same amount of days that you normally work in a week. For example, if you only work on Mondays and Tuesdays, then a week of leave is 2 days.\n\nYour leave cannot start before the birth. It must end within 56 days of the birth (or due date, if the baby is early). The start and end date rules are different [if you adopt](https://www.gov.uk/paternity-pay-leave/adoption).\n\nYou must give your employer 28 days\u2019 notice if you want to change your start date.\n\nYou do not have to give a precise date when you want to take leave. Instead you can give a general time, such as the day of the birth or one week after the birth.\n\n### If the baby is due after 6 April 2024, or on or after 6 April 2024 for adoptions\n\nYou can take either 1 or 2 weeks\u2019 leave. If you choose to take 2 weeks, you can take them together or separately. You get the same amount of leave even if you have more than one child (for example, twins).\n\nA week of leave is the same amount of days that you normally work in a week. For example, if you only work on Mondays and Tuesdays, then a week of leave is 2 days.\n\nYour leave cannot start before the birth.

Instead you can give a general time, such as the day of the birth or one week after the birth.\n\nThere are different rules [if you live in Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/paternity-leave).\n\n## Shared Parental Leave\n\nYou may also be eligible for [Shared Parental Leave](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay) (SPL). You cannot take Paternity Leave after you take SPL.\n\n## Leave for antenatal appointments\n\nYou can take unpaid leave to accompany a pregnant woman to 2 antenatal appointments if you\u2019re:\n\n  * the baby\u2019s father\n  * the expectant mother\u2019s spouse or civil partner\n  * in a long-term relationship with the expectant mother\n  * the intended parent (if you\u2019re having a baby through a surrogacy arrangement)\n\n\n\nYou can take up to 6 and a half hours per appointment. Your employer can choose to give you longer.\n\nYou can apply for leave immediately if you\u2019re a permanent employee. You\u2019ll need to have been doing a job for 12 weeks before you qualify if you\u2019re an agency worker.\n\n## Leave for adoption appointments\n\nYou can take unpaid leave to attend 2 adoption appointments after you\u2019ve been matched with a child.\n\nYou can take up to 6 and a half hours per appointment.

You\u2019ll need to have been doing a job for 12 weeks before you qualify if you\u2019re an agency worker.\n\n## Pay \n\nThe statutory weekly rate of Paternity Pay is \u00a3184.03, or 90% of your average weekly earnings (whichever is lower).\n\nAny money you get is paid in the same way as your wages, for example monthly or weekly. Tax and National Insurance will be deducted.\n\n## Start and end dates\n\nThe money is usually paid while you\u2019re on leave. Your employer must confirm the start and end dates for your Paternity Pay when you claim it.\n\nTo change the start date you must give your employer 28 days\u2019 notice before the block of paid leave begins.\n\nYou could get more pay if your employer has a company paternity scheme - they cannot offer you less than the statutory amounts.\n\n## Eligibility \n\nYou must be taking time off to look after the child and be one of the following:\n\n  * the father\n  * the husband or partner of the mother (or adopter) - this includes same-sex partners\n  * the child\u2019s adopter\n  * the intended parent (if you\u2019re having a baby through a surrogacy arrangement)\n\n\n\nThere are extra conditions you need to meet to qualify for leave and pay.\n\nYou cannot get Paternity Pay and Leave if you\u2019ve taken paid time off to attend adoption appointments.\n\n## Paternity Leave\n\nYou must:\n\n  * be [an employee](/employment-status)\n  * give the [correct notice](/paternity-pay-leave/how-to-claim)\n  * have been [continuously employed by your employer](/continuous-employment-what-it-is) for at least 26 weeks up to any day in the \u2018qualifying week\u2019\n\n\n\nThe \u2018qualifying week\u2019 is the 15th week before the baby is due. This is different [if you adopt](/paternity-pay-leave/adoption).\n\n## Paternity Pay\n\nYou must:\n\n  * be employed by your employer up to the date of birth\n  * earn an average of at least \u00a3123 a week (before tax)\n  * give the [correct notice](/paternity-pay-leave/how-to-claim)\n  * have been [continuously employed by your employer](/continuous-employment-what-it-is) for at least 26 weeks up to the end of any day in the \u2018qualifying week\u2019\n\n\n\nThe \u2018qualifying week\u2019 is the 15th week before the baby is due. This is different [if you adopt](/paternity-pay-leave/adoption).\n\n## If you lose your baby\n\nYou can still get Paternity Leave or Pay if your baby is:\n\n  * stillborn from 24 weeks of pregnancy\n  * born alive at any point during the pregnancy\n\n\n\nYou can take any leave you booked before losing the baby. If after losing the baby you have leave left to book, you can still book and take this. You must do this within 8 weeks of the death.\n\nYou may also be eligible for [Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay and Leave](/parental-bereavement-pay-leave).\n\n## If you\u2019re not eligible\n\nYour employer must tell you within 28 days if you do not qualify and why using form SPP1.\n\n## How to claim \n\nYou claim Paternity Leave and Pay through your employer. You must give your employer at least 15 weeks\u2019 notice.\n\nYou can do this by [filling in the online form](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/fill-online/apply-for-statutory-paternity-pay/becoming-adoptive-or-parental-order-parents) (previously called form SC3). Once you have completed the form, you will need to download or print it and send it to your employer.\n\nCheck if your employer has their own form. If they do, use that instead.\n\nThe rules and forms are different [if you adopt](/paternity-pay-leave/adoption).\n\nYou\u2019ll need to include:\n\n  * the due date\n  * when you want your leave to start, for example the day of the birth or the week after the birth\n  * if you want 1 or 2 weeks\u2019 leave\n\n\n\nYou do not need to give proof of the pregnancy or birth.\n\nUse the [paternity planner](/pay-leave-for-parents) to find out when you need to claim Paternity Leave by.\n\n## Adoption and surrogacy \n\n## Eligibility\n\nYou must have been [continuously employed by your employer](/continuous-employment-what-it-is) for at least 26 weeks up to the end of any day in the \u2018qualifying week\u2019.\n\nFor adoptions in the UK, this is the week you\u2019re matched with the child.\n\nFor overseas adoptions, this is either:\n\n  * the week the child enters the UK\n  * the week you want your pay or leave to start\n\n\n\nYou must also meet the other [eligibility conditions](/paternity-pay-leave/eligibility) for paternity leave or pay.\n\n## Start and end dates - Paternity Leave\n\nYour period of Paternity Leave can start as early as:\n\n  * the date of placement\n  * the date the child arrives in the UK if you\u2019re adopting from overseas\n  * the date the child\u2019s born (or the day after if you\u2019re working that day) if you\u2019re a surrogate parent\n  * a date you choose which falls after the date of birth or placement\n\n\n\nYou must give your employer 28 days\u2019 notice if you want to change your start date.\n\n### For adoptions within the UK and from overseas\n\nIf the child is expected to be placed or to arrive in England, Scotland or Wales:\n\n  * before 6 April 2024, your leave must end within 56 days of the placement or arrival date\n  * on or after 6 April 2024, your leave must end within 52 weeks of the placement or arrival date\n\n\n\nThere are different rules for adoptions [if you live in Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/paternity-leave).\n\n### For surrogate parents\n\nIf the child is expected to be born:\n\n  * on or before 6 April 2024, your leave must end within 56 days of the child\u2019s birth\n  * after 6 April 2024, your leave must end within 52 weeks of the child\u2019s birth\n\n\n\n## How to claim - Paternity Leave or Pay\n\nYou can use [form SC4](/government/publications/ordinary-statutory-paternity-pay-and-leave-becoming-an-adoptive-parent-sc4) (or your employer\u2019s own version) for:\n\n  * adoption - within 7 days of your co-adopter or partner being matched with a child\n  * surrogacy arrangements - 28 days, or as soon as you\u2019re reasonably able, before you want your pay to start\n\n\n\nFor overseas adoptions the form and notice period is different.

This includes your right to:\n\n  * pay rises\n  * build up (accrue) holiday\n  * return to work\n\n## Leave \n\nStatutory Adoption Leave is 52 weeks. It\u2019s made up of:\n\n  * 26 weeks of Ordinary Adoption Leave\n  * 26 weeks of Additional Adoption Leave\n\n\n\nOnly 1 person in a couple can take adoption leave. The other partner could get [paternity leave](/paternity-pay-leave) instead.\n\nIf you get adoption leave, you can also get paid time off work to attend 5 adoption appointments after you\u2019ve been matched with a child.\n\nUse [the planner](/plan-adoption-leave) to work out the dates for your adoption leave.\n\n## Start date\n\nAdoption leave can start:\n\n  * up to 14 days before the date the child starts living with you (UK adoptions)\n  * when the child arrives in the UK or within 28 days of this date (overseas adoptions)\n  * the day the child\u2019s born or the day after (if you\u2019ve used a surrogate to have a child)\n\n\n\n## Change your dates\n\nYou must tell your employer within 28 days if the date of placement (or UK arrival date for overseas adoptions) changes.\n\nYou must give your employer at least 8 weeks\u2019 notice if you want to change your return to work date.\n\n## Pay \n\nStatutory Adoption Pay is paid for up to 39 weeks. The weekly amount is:\n\n  * 90% of your average weekly earnings for the first 6 weeks\n  * \u00a3184.03 or 90% of your average weekly earnings (whichever is lower) for the next 33 weeks\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s paid in the same way as your wages (for example monthly or weekly). Tax and National Insurance will be deducted.\n\n## Extra pay\n\nYou may get more pay if your employer has a company adoption pay scheme. Your employer cannot offer you less than the statutory amount.\n\n## Start date\n\nStatutory Adoption Pay starts when you take your adoption leave.\n\n## Problems and disputes\n\nIf you disagree with the amount of Statutory Adoption Pay you get or your employer cannot pay it, for example because they\u2019re insolvent, [contact the Statutory Payment Disputes Team](/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/statutory-payment-dispute-team).\n\n## Eligibility \n\nThere are different eligibility rules for leave and pay.\n\n## Adoption leave\n\nTo get Statutory Adoption Leave, you must:\n\n  * be an employee\n  * give the [correct notice](/adoption-pay-leave/how-to-claim)\n  * give [proof of the adoption or surrogacy](/adoption-pay-leave/how-to-claim), if your employer asks you for it\n\n\n\n### Leave if you\u2019re adopting a child from overseas\n\nYou must also sign [form SC6](/government/publications/statutory-adoption-pay-and-leave-adopting-a-child-from-abroad-sc6) if you\u2019re adopting from overseas with a partner. This confirms you\u2019re not taking paternity leave or pay.\n\n## Adoption pay\n\nTo get Statutory Adoption Pay, you must:\n\n  * have been [continuously employed by your employer](/continuous-employment-what-it-is) for at least 26 weeks by the week you were matched with a child\n  * earn on average at least \u00a3123 a week (before tax)\n  * give the [correct notice](/adoption-pay-leave/how-to-claim)\n  * give [proof of the adoption or surrogacy](/adoption-pay-leave/how-to-claim)\n\n\n\nIf you usually earn an average of \u00a3123 or more a week, and you only earned less in some weeks because you were paid but not working (\u2018on furlough\u2019) under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, you may still be eligible.\n\n### Pay if you\u2019re adopting a child from overseas\n\nThe requirements are the same if you\u2019re adopting from overseas, except you must have been continuously employed by your employer for at least 26 weeks when you start getting adoption pay.\n\nYou must also sign [form SC6](/government/publications/statutory-adoption-pay-and-leave-adopting-a-child-from-abroad-sc6) if you\u2019re adopting from overseas with a partner. This confirms you\u2019re not taking paternity leave or pay.\n\n### Pay if you\u2019re in a surrogacy arrangement\n\nThe requirements are the same if you\u2019re in a surrogacy arrangement, except you must have been continuously employed by your employer for at least 26 weeks by the 15th week before the baby\u2019s due.\n\nYou must also:\n\n  * intend to apply for a [parental order](/become-a-childs-legal-parent)\n  * expect the order to be granted (for example because you do not have any convictions involving children, and the birth mother or father agree to the arrangement)\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re genetically related to the child (the egg or sperm donor), you can choose to get [paternity leave and pay](/paternity-pay-leave) instead. You cannot get both.\n\n## You\u2019re fostering for adoption\n\nIf you\u2019re eligible for adoption pay and leave, you\u2019ll receive them from when the child comes to live with you.\n\n## Exceptions\n\nYou do not qualify for Statutory Adoption Leave or Pay if you:\n\n  * arrange a private adoption\n  * become a special guardian or kinship carer\n  * adopt a stepchild\n  * adopt a family member\n\n\n\n## If you\u2019re not eligible\n\nYour employer must give you form SAP1 explaining why you cannot get Statutory Adoption Pay.\n\nYou may get support from your [local council](/find-your-local-council) instead, if you\u2019re adopting a child.\n\n## How to claim \n\nThe rules are slightly different if you\u2019re adopting from overseas or you\u2019re having a child through a surrogacy arrangement.\n\n## Statutory Adoption Leave\n\nWithin 7 days of being matched with a child you must tell your employer:\n\n  * how much leave you want\n  * your leave start date\n  * the \u2018date of placement\u2019 - the date the child is placed with you\n\n\n\nYour employer can ask for this in writing and for proof of the adoption.\n\nYour employer must confirm your leave start and end dates within 28 days.\n\n[Use the planner](/plan-adoption-leave) to work out when you must claim your adoption leave.\n\n## Statutory Adoption Pay\n\nTell your employer you want to stop work to adopt a child and when you want your Statutory Adoption Pay to start. You must give them at least 28 days\u2019 notice. They can ask for this in writing and for proof of the adoption.\n\nYour employer must confirm within 28 days how much Statutory Adoption Pay you\u2019ll get and when it will start and stop.\n\nIf they decide you\u2019re not eligible, they must give you form SAP1 within 7 days of making their decision and explain why.\n\n## Proof of adoption\n\nYou must give your employer proof of adoption to qualify for Statutory Adoption Pay. Proof is not needed for Statutory Adoption Leave unless they request it.\n\nThe proof must show:\n\n  * your name and address and that of the agency\n  * the match date - for example the matching certificate\n  * the date of placement - for example a letter from the agency\n  * the relevant UK authority\u2019s \u2018official notification\u2019 confirming you\u2019re allowed to adopt (overseas adoptions only)\n  * the date the child arrived in the UK - for example a plane ticket (overseas adoptions only)\n\n\n\n## Overseas adoptions\n\nTell your employer the date of your \u2018official notification\u2019 and when you expect the child to arrive in the UK. You must usually do this within 28 days of getting the notification.\n\nYou can only take longer if you\u2019ve worked for your employer for less than 26 weeks. Tell them within 28 days of the Sunday in your 26th week.\n\nYou must also tell them:\n\n  * the actual date the child arrives in the UK - within 28 days of this date\n  * how much leave you want and your start date - giving your employer 28 days\u2019 notice\n\n\n\n## Surrogacy arrangements\n\nIf you use a surrogate to have a baby, tell your employer the due date and when you want to start your leave at least 15 weeks before the expected week of birth. They may ask for this in writing.\n\nYour employer may also ask for a written statement (\u2018statutory declaration\u2019) to confirm you\u2019ve applied or will apply for a [parental order](/become-a-childs-legal-parent) in the 6 months after the child\u2019s birth. You must sign this in the presence of a legal professional.",

      "body": "## Eligibility \n\nWidowed Parent\u2019s Allowance (WPA) has been replaced by [Bereavement Support Payment](/bereavement-support-payment). If you already get WPA, your payments will continue until you are no longer eligible.\n\nThis guide is also available [in Welsh (Cymraeg)](/lwfans-rhaint-gweddw).\n\nYou can only make a new claim for WPA if your partner died before 6 April 2017. When they died, you and your partner must have either been:\n\n  * married or in a civil partnership\n  * living together as though you were married or in a civil partnership\n\n\n\nIf you were married or in a civil partnership, your partner must also have only recently been declared dead. You\u2019ll need to confirm the cause of death.\n\nAll the following must also apply:\n\n  * you\u2019re under [State Pension age](/calculate-state-pension)\n  * your partner paid [National Insurance contributions](/national-insurance/how-much-you-pay), or they died because of an accident at work or a disease caused by work\n  * you\u2019re entitled to [Child Benefit](/child-benefit) for at least one child\n\n\n\nYou may also claim WPA if you were pregnant when your partner died, or you were pregnant after fertility treatment when your partner died.\n\n## When you cannot claim WPA\n\nYou cannot claim WPA if you:\n\n  * were divorced or had ended your civil partnership when your partner died\n  * were no longer living with your partner when they died\n  * have remarried or formed a new civil partnership\n  * are living with another person as if you\u2019re married or in a civil partnership with them\n  * were over State Pension age when your partner died \u2013 you may be able to get [extra State Pension](/state-pension/inheritance-spouse-civil-partner)\n  * are in prison\n\n## What you'll get \n\nThe amount you get is based on how much your partner paid in National Insurance contributions.\n\nThe maximum Widowed Parent\u2019s Allowance (WPA) is \u00a3148.40 a week.\n\nIf your partner died because of an accident at work or a disease caused by work, you may claim WPA even if they did not pay National Insurance contributions.\n\nYou\u2019ll continue to get WPA until you either:\n\n  * stop being entitled to [Child Benefit](/child-benefit)\n  * reach [State Pension age](/state-pension-age)\n\n\n\n## How WPA is paid\n\nWPA is usually [paid into your bank, building society or credit union account](/how-to-have-your-benefits-paid).\n\n## Report changes that affect other benefits\n\nOther benefit payments you get may change when you start claiming WPA.\n\nOnce you get WPA, you must report it if you\u2019re getting any of the following:\n\n  * [Income Support](/income-support/report-a-change-of-circumstances)\n  * [Incapacity Benefit](/incapacity-benefit)\n  * [Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance](/jobseekers-allowance/report-a-change-of-circumstances)\n  * [Carer\u2019s Allowance](/carers-allowance/effect-on-other-benefits)\n  * [Carer Support Payment](https://www.mygov.scot/carer-support-payment/if-your-circumstances-change)\n  * [Employment and Support Allowance](/employment-support-allowance/change-of-circumstances)\n  * [Universal Credit](/universal-credit/changes-of-circumstances)\n\n\n\nIf you do not report changes straight away, you could be paid the wrong amount and have to pay it back. You might also have to pay a fine.\n\n### The benefit cap\n\nThe [benefit cap](/benefit-cap) limits the total amount of benefit you can get.

      "body": "## Overview \n\nEmployees may be able to get Shared Parental Leave (SPL) and Statutory Shared Parental Pay (ShPP) if they\u2019ve had a baby or adopted a child.\n\nThis guide is also available [in Welsh (Cymraeg)](/absenoldeb-a-thal-ar-y-cyd-i-rieni-canllaw-i-gyflogwyr).\n\nEmployees can [start SPL](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay-employer-guide/starting-shared-parental-leave) if [they\u2019re eligible](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay-employer-guide/eligibility) and they or their partner end their maternity or adoption leave or pay early. The remaining leave will be available as SPL. The remaining pay may be available as ShPP.\n\nEmployees can take SPL in up to 3 separate [blocks of leave](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay-employer-guide/blocks-of-leave). They can also share the leave with their partner if they\u2019re also eligible. Parents can choose how much of the SPL each of them will take.\n\nExample\n\nA mother and her partner are both eligible for SPL and ShPP. The mother ends her maternity leave and pay after 12 weeks, leaving 40 weeks available for SPL and 27 weeks available for ShPP. The parents can choose how to split this.\n\nSPL and ShPP must be taken between the baby\u2019s birth and first birthday (or within 1 year of adoption).\n\nSPL and ShPP are only available in England, Scotland and Wales.\n\n## Eligibility \n\nSometimes only one parent in a couple will be eligible to get Shared Parental Leave (SPL) and Statutory Shared Parental Pay (ShPP). This means that they cannot share the leave.\n\nIf your employee is eligible then they can use SPL to book their leave in [separate blocks](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay-employer-guide/blocks-of-leave).\n\n## Shared Parental Leave\n\nTo qualify for SPL, your employee must share responsibility for the child with one of the following:\n\n  * their husband, wife, civil partner or joint adopter\n  * the child\u2019s other parent\n  * their partner (if they live with them)\n\n\n\nYour employee or their partner must be eligible for [maternity pay or leave](/maternity-pay-leave/eligibility), [adoption pay or leave](/adoption-pay-leave/eligibility) or [Maternity Allowance](/maternity-allowance/eligibility).\n\nThey must also:\n\n  * still be employed by you while they take SPL\n  * give you the [correct notice](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay-employer-guide/starting-shared-parental-leave) including a declaration that their partner meets the employment and income requirements which allow your employee to get SPL\n  * have been [continuously employed by you](/continuous-employment-what-it-is) for at least 26 weeks up to any day of the \u2018qualifying week\u2019, or the week they are matched with a child for adoption in the UK\n\n\n\nThe \u2018qualifying week\u2019 is the 15th week before the baby is due.\n\n## Statutory Shared Parental Pay\n\nThey can get ShPP if they\u2019re [an employee](/employment-status/employee) and one of the following applies:\n\n  * they\u2019re eligible for [Statutory Maternity Pay](/employers-maternity-pay-leave) (SMP) or [Statutory Adoption Pay](/adoption-pay-leave/eligibility) (SAP)\n  * they\u2019re eligible for [Statutory Paternity Pay](/paternity-pay-leave/eligibility) (SPP) and their partner is eligible for SMP, [Maternity Allowance](/maternity-allowance/eligibility) (MA) or SAP\n\n\n\nThey can also get ShPP if they\u2019re [a worker](/employment-status/worker) and they\u2019re eligible for SMP or SPP.\n\n## Refusing SPL or ShPP\n\nYou can refuse SPL or ShPP if the employee does not qualify.\n\nYou must tell the employee the reason if you refuse ShPP. You do not have to give a reason for refusing SPL.\n\n## Entitlement \n\nIf an [employee is eligible](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay-employer-guide/eligibility) and they or their partner end maternity or adoption leave and pay (or Maternity Allowance) early, then they can:\n\n  * take the rest of the 52 weeks of leave (up to a maximum of 50 weeks) as Shared Parental Leave (SPL)\n  * take the rest of the 39 weeks of pay (up to a maximum of 37 weeks) as Statutory Shared Parental Pay (ShPP)\n\n\n\nA mother must take a minimum of 2 weeks\u2019 maternity leave following the birth (4 if she works in a factory).\n\nShPP is paid at the rate of \u00a3184.03 a week or 90% of an employee\u2019s average weekly earnings, whichever is lower.\n\n## Extra leave or pay\n\nYou can offer more than the statutory amounts if you have a company scheme for shared parental leave and pay. You must make sure your scheme\u2019s policies are clear and available to staff.\n\n## Reclaiming payments\n\nEven if you pay an employee more than the statutory amount, you can usually only reclaim 92% of that amount. You may be able to reclaim 103% if you qualify for Small Employers\u2019 Relief. Read more about [reclaiming statutory pay](/recover-statutory-payments).\n\n## Starting Shared Parental Leave \n\nFor Shared Parental Leave (SPL) to start, the mother or adopter must do one of the following:\n\n  * end their maternity or adoption leave by returning to work\n  * give you \u2018binding notice\u2019 (a decision that cannot normally be changed) of the date when they\u2019ll end their maternity or adoption leave\n  * end maternity pay or Maternity Allowance (if they\u2019re not entitled to maternity leave, for example they\u2019re an agency worker or self-employed)\n\n\n\nA mother must take a minimum of 2 weeks\u2019 maternity leave following the birth (4 if she works in a factory).\n\nThe adoptive parent getting Statutory Adoption Pay must take at least 2 weeks\u2019 adoption leave. They can take it from the day of the placement, or up to 14 days before the placement starts.\n\nThe mother must give you notice (at least 8 weeks) to end her maternity pay, or tell Jobcentre Plus to end her Maternity Allowance. Adopters must give you notice to end adoption pay.\n\nSPL can start for the partner while the mother or adopter is still on maternity or adoption leave if she\u2019s given binding notice to end her leave (or pay if she\u2019s not entitled to leave).\n\nExample\n\nA mother and her partner are both eligible for SPL.\n\nThe mother goes on maternity leave 10 weeks before her baby is born. She decides that she\u2019ll take 16 weeks of maternity leave and gives you notice.\n\nSince the mother has given binding notice, her partner can start SPL as soon as the baby has been born (as long as they\u2019ve given at least 8 weeks\u2019 notice).\n\n## What the employee must do\n\nThe employee must give you written notice if they want to start SPL or Statutory Shared Parental Pay (ShPP). They can do this using [forms created by the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas)](https://www.acas.org.uk/shared-parental-leave-form-templates).\n\nAfter receiving this notice, you can ask for:\n\n  * a copy of the child\u2019s birth certificate\n  * the name and address of their partner\u2019s employer\n\n\n\nYou have 14 days to ask for this information. Your employee then has a further 14 days to provide it.\n\n## Notice period\n\nAn employee must give at least 8 weeks\u2019 notice of any leave they wish to take. If the child is born more than 8 weeks early, this notice period can be shorter.\n\nYour employee has a statutory right to a maximum of 3 separate [blocks of leave](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay-employer-guide/blocks-of-leave), although you can allow more if you wish.\n\n## Cancelling the decision to end maternity or adoption leave\n\nThe mother or adopter may be able to change their decision to end maternity or adoption leave early if both:\n\n  * the planned end date has not passed\n  * they have not already returned to work\n\n\n\nOne of the following must also apply:\n\n  * it\u2019s discovered during the 8-week notice period that neither partner is eligible for either SPL or ShPP\n  * the employee\u2019s partner has died\n  * it\u2019s less than 6 weeks after the birth (and the mother gave notice before the birth)\n\n\n\n## Shared parental leave in touch (SPLIT) days\n\nYour employee can work up to 20 days during SPL without bringing it to an end. These are called \u2018shared parental leave in touch\u2019 (or SPLIT) days.\n\nThese days are in addition to the 10 \u2018keeping in touch\u2019 (or KIT) days already available to those on maternity or adoption leave.\n\nKeeping in touch days are optional - both you and your employee must agree to them.\n\n## Blocks of leave \n\nAn employee taking Shared Parental Leave (SPL) can split their leave into up to 3 separate blocks instead of taking it all in one go, even if they are not sharing the leave with their partner.\n\nIf both parents are taking SPL then they can take their leave at the same time as each other or at different times.\n\nThe employee must give you at least 8 weeks\u2019 notice before a block of leave begins.\n\n## Splitting blocks\n\nIf you agree, the employee can split a block of leave into shorter periods of at least a week. For example they could work every other week during a 12-week block, using a total of 6 weeks of their SPL.\n\nYou cannot turn down a request for a block of leave if the employee is eligible and gives you the right notice. You do not have to agree to the employee breaking the block of leave into shorter periods.\n\n## Record keeping \n\nYou must keep records for HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), including:\n\n  * the evidence provided by the employee to show that they\u2019re eligible for ShPP\n  * the date ShPP began\n  * your ShPP payments (including dates)\n  * the ShPP you\u2019ve reclaimed\n  * any weeks you did not pay and why\n\n\n\nYou must keep records for at least 3 years from the end of the tax year they relate to.\n\n## Help with statutory pay \n\nFor [financial help with statutory pay](/recover-statutory-payments), you can:\n\n  * reclaim payments (usually 92%)\n  * apply for an advance if you cannot afford payments\n\n\n  *[SPL]: Shared Parental Leave\n  *[ShPP]: Shared Parental Pay\n  *[SMP]: Statutory Maternity Pay\n  *[SAP]: Statutory Adoption Pay\n  *[SPP]: Statutory Paternity Pay\n  *[MA]: Maternity Allowance\n  *[Acas]: Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service\n  *[SPLIT]: Shared parental leave in touch\n  *[KIT]: Keeping in touch\n  *[HMRC]: HM Revenue and Customs",

You can also choose to be off work together or to stagger the leave and pay.\n\nTo get SPL and ShPP, you and your partner need to:\n\n  * meet the eligibility criteria - there\u2019s different [criteria for birth parents](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay/eligibility-for-birth-parents) and [criteria for adoptive parents or parents using a surrogate](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay/eligibility-for-adopters)\n\n  * [give notice to your employers](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay/applying-for-leave-and-pay)\n\n  * give up some of your maternity or adoption leave and pay\n\n\n\n\n## Giving up maternity and adoption leave and pay\n\nTo get SPL and ShPP you or your partner has to:\n\n  * take less than the 52 weeks of maternity or adoption leave and use the rest as SPL\n  * take less than the 39 weeks of maternity or adoption pay (or Maternity Allowance) and use the rest as ShPP\n\n\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re the mother and you\u2019ve taken 22 weeks of Maternity Leave and Statutory Maternity Pay, you can share 30 weeks of SPL and 17 weeks of ShPP with your partner.\n\n## Eligibility for birth parents \n\nTo be eligible for Shared Parental Leave (SPL) and Statutory Shared Parental Pay (ShPP), both parents must:\n\n  * share responsibility for the child at birth\n  * meet work and pay criteria - these are different depending on which parent wants to use the shared parental leave and pay\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re not eligible if you started sharing responsibility for the child after it was born.\n\nThe eligibility criteria are different [if you\u2019re adoptive parents or parents using a surrogate](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay/eligibility-for-adopters).\n\nYou can [check if you can get SPL and ShPP](https://www.check-shared-parental-leave.service.gov.uk/).

You\u2019ll need to know:\n\n  * your child\u2019s due date or birth date if you\u2019re using a surrogate, or the match date if you\u2019re adopting or fostering to adopt\n  * your and your partner\u2019s [employment status](/employment-status) and earnings\n  * if you and your partner can get [Statutory Adoption Pay](/adoption-pay-leave/eligibility) or [Statutory Paternity Pay](/paternity-pay-leave/eligibility)\n\n\n\n## If both parents want to share the SPL and ShPP\n\nBoth parents must meet the same eligibility criteria.\n\nTo be eligible for SPL and ShPP, you must stay with the same employer until you start your SPL. You must be employed continuously by them for at least 26 weeks, by either:\n\n  * the end of the week you or your partner are matched with a child if you\u2019re adopting\n  * the end of the 15th week before the due date if you\u2019re using a surrogate\n\n\n\nTo be eligible for SPL, you must be \u2018employees\u2019 (not \u2018workers\u2019) - check your [employment status](/employment-status). If either of you is a \u2018worker\u2019, you might be able to share ShPP but not SPL.\n\nTo be eligible for ShPP, you must each earn on average at least \u00a3123 a week. If you usually earn an average of \u00a3123 or more a week each, and you only earned less in some weeks because you were on furlough under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS), you may still be eligible.\n\n## If only one of the parents wants to take the SPL and ShPP\n\nBoth parents must meet some eligibility criteria.\n\n### Criteria for the parent taking SPL and ShPP\n\nThe parent who wants to take the leave and pay must stay with the same employer until they start their SPL.\n\nThey must also have been employed continuously by the same employer for at least 26 weeks, by either:\n\n  * the end of the week you or your partner are matched with a child if you\u2019re adopting\n  * the end of the 15th week before the due date if you\u2019re using a surrogate\n\n\n\nTo be eligible for SPL, they must be an \u2018employee\u2019 (not a \u2018worker\u2019) - check their [employment status](/employment-status). If they are a \u2018worker\u2019, they might be able to get ShPP but not SPL.\n\nTo be eligible for ShPP, they must earn on average at least \u00a3123 each a week. If they earned less than the amount needed because they were on furlough under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, they may still be eligible.\n\n### Criteria for the other parent\n\nThe other parent must:\n\n  * have been working for at least 26 weeks out of the 66 weeks before the week the child was placed with you (the 26 weeks do not need to be in a row)\n  * have earned at least \u00a3390 in total in 13 of the 66 weeks (add up the highest paying weeks - they do not need to be in a row)\n\n\n\nIf they earned less than the amount needed because they were on furlough under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, they may still be eligible.\n\n## What you'll get \n\nYou can share up to 50 weeks of leave and up to 37 weeks of pay between you.\n\nThe actual amount depends on how much maternity or adoption leave and pay (or Maternity Allowance) you or your partner take. If you or your partner are eligible then you can:\n\n  * take less than the 52 weeks of maternity or adoption leave and use the rest as Shared Parental Leave (SPL)\n  * take less than the 39 weeks of maternity or adoption pay (or Maternity Allowance) and use the rest as Statutory Shared Parental Pay (ShPP)\n\n\n\nYou can [check when you and your partner can take your leave and how much statutory pay you\u2019ll get](/plan-shared-parental-leave-pay) using the Shared Parental Leave and Pay planning tool.\n\n## How much pay you\u2019ll get\n\nShPP is paid at the rate of \u00a3184.03 a week or 90% of your average weekly earnings, whichever is lower.\n\nThis is the same as [Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP)](/maternity-pay-leave/pay) except that during the first 6 weeks SMP is paid at 90% of whatever you earn (with no maximum).\n\n### Example\n\nA woman decides to start her maternity leave 4 weeks before the due date and gives notice that she\u2019ll start SPL from 10 weeks after the birth (taking a total of 14 weeks maternity leave). She normally earns \u00a3200 a week.\n\nShe\u2019s paid \u00a3180 (90% of her average weekly earnings) as SMP for the first 6 weeks of maternity leave, then \u00a3184.03 a week for the next 8 weeks. Once she goes onto SPL, she\u2019s still paid \u00a3184.03 a week.\n\n## When you can start \n\nYou can only start Shared Parental Leave (SPL) or Shared Parental Pay (ShPP) once the child has been born or placed with your family for adoption.\n\nYou can [check when you and your partner can start your leave](/plan-shared-parental-leave-pay) using the Shared Parental Leave and Pay planning tool.\n\n## For SPL to start\n\nThe mother (or the person getting adoption leave) must either:\n\n  * return to work, which ends any maternity or adoption leave\n  * give their employer \u2018binding notice\u2019 of the date when they plan to end their leave (you cannot normally change the date you give in binding notice)\n\n\n\nYou can start SPL while your partner is still on maternity or adoption leave as long as they\u2019ve given binding notice to end it.\n\nYou can give binding notice and say when you plan to [take your SPL](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay/applying-for-leave-and-pay) at the same time.\n\nA mother cannot return to work before the end of the compulsory 2 weeks of maternity leave following the birth (4 weeks if they work in a factory). If you\u2019re adopting, the person claiming adoption pay must take at least 2 weeks of adoption leave.\n\n### If the mother or adopter does not get maternity or adoption leave\n\nThe mother or adopter must end any maternity pay, adoption pay or Maternity Allowance so that they or their partner can get SPL.\n\n## For ShPP to start\n\nThe mother (or the person getting adoption pay) must give their employer binding notice of the date when they plan to end any maternity or adoption pay.\n\nIf they get Maternity Allowance, they must give notice to Jobcentre Plus instead.\n\nThey cannot restart maternity pay, Maternity Allowance or adoption pay once it\u2019s ended.\n\nYou can start ShPP while your partner is still on maternity pay, adoption pay or Maternity Allowance as long as they\u2019ve given binding notice to end it.\n\nYou can give binding notice and say when you plan to [take your ShPP](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay/applying-for-leave-and-pay) at the same time.\n\n## Change the decision to end maternity or adoption leave\n\nThe mother or adopter may be able to change their decision to end maternity or adoption leave early. They must let their employer know.\n\nThey can only change the decision if both:\n\n  * the planned end date has not passed\n  * they have not already returned to work\n\n\n\nOne of the following must also apply:\n\n  * you find out during the 8-week notice period that neither of you is eligible for SPL or ShPP\n  * the mother or adopter\u2019s partner has died\n  * the mother tells their employer less than 6 weeks after the birth (and they gave their employer notice before the birth)\n\n## Booking blocks of leave \n\nYou can book up to 3 separate blocks of Shared Parental Leave (SPL) instead of taking it all in one go, even if you are not sharing the leave with your partner.\n\nIf your partner is also eligible for SPL, you can take up to 3 blocks of leave each. You can take leave at different times or both at the same time.\n\nYou can take more than 3 blocks of leave if your employer agrees.\n\nYou must tell your employer about your plans for leave when you [apply for SPL](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay/apply-for-shared-parental-leave). You can change these plans later but you must give your employer at least 8 weeks\u2019 notice before you want to begin a block of leave.\n\nYou can [check when you and your partner can take your leave](/plan-shared-parental-leave-pay) using the Shared Parental Leave and Pay planning tool.\n\n## Splitting blocks of leave\n\nIf your employer agrees, you can split blocks into shorter periods of at least a week.\n\n### Example\n\nA mother finishes her maternity leave at the end of October and takes the rest of her leave as SPL. She shares it with her partner, who\u2019s also eligible. They each take the whole of November as their first blocks of SPL. The partner then returns to work.\n\nThe mother also returns to work in December. She gives her employer notice that she\u2019ll go on leave again in February - this is her second block of SPL. Her employer agrees to a work pattern of 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off during the block.\n\n## Shared Parental Leave in touch (SPLIT) days\n\nYou and your partner can each work up to 20 days while you\u2019re taking SPL. These are called \u2018Shared Parental Leave in touch\u2019 (or SPLIT) days.\n\nThese days are in addition to the 10 [\u2018keeping in touch\u2019](/employee-rights-when-on-leave) (or KIT) days available to those on maternity or adoption leave.\n\nKIT and SPLIT days are optional - both you and your employer must agree to them.\n\n## Applying for leave and pay \n\nTo get Shared Parental Leave (SPL) or Shared Parental Pay (ShPP) you must:\n\n  * follow the rules for [starting SPL and ShPP](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay/when-you-can-start)\n  * give your employer at least 8 weeks\u2019 written notice of your leave dates\n\n\n\nYou can use [Shared Parental Leave forms and templates](https://www.acas.org.uk/shared-parental-leave-form-templates) created by Acas to:\n\n  * give your employer notice that you plan to take SPL and ShPP\n  * give your employer notice of when the mother or adopter is going to end their maternity or adoption leave, and when they\u2019ll stop getting maternity or adoption pay\n  * book your leave dates\n\n\n\nIf your employer has their own forms you can use those instead.\n\nYou can change your mind later about how much SPL or ShPP you plan to take and when you want to take it. You must give notice of any changes at least 8 weeks before the start of any leave.\n\nYou might not get SPL or ShPP if you do not include all the required information.\n\n## Giving more information\n\nYour employer can ask you for more information within 14 days of you applying for SPL or ShPP. They can ask for:\n\n  * a copy of the birth certificate\n  * a declaration of the place and date of birth (if the birth has not been registered yet)\n  * the name and address of your partner\u2019s employer or a declaration that your partner has no employer\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re adopting or fostering a child you\u2019re planning to adopt, your employer can ask for the:\n\n  * name and address of the adoption agency or local authority\n  * date you were matched with the child\n  * date the child will start to live with you\n  * name and address of your partner\u2019s employer or a declaration that your partner has no employer\n\n\n\nYou must give this information within 14 days of being asked for it.\n  *[SPL]: Shared Parental Leave\n  *[ShPP]: Statutory Shared Parental Pay\n  *[CJRS]: Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme\n  *[SMP]: Statutory Maternity Pay\n  *[SPLIT]: Shared Parental Leave in touch\n  *[KIT]: keeping in touch\n  *[Acas]: Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service",

It\u2019s made up of 2 letters, 6 numbers and a final letter.\n\nFor example, QQ123456B.\n\nYou\u2019ll usually get a letter confirming your National Insurance number shortly before your 16th birthday. This will be sent to the address HMRC has for you.\n\n## If you need your National Insurance number\n\nYour National Insurance number will be on tax-related documents like your payslip or P60. You can also get a letter with it on and [find your National Insurance number online](/lost-national-insurance-number).\n\n## If you\u2019ve never had a National Insurance number\n\nYou can [apply for a National Insurance number](/apply-national-insurance-number) if you\u2019ve never had one.\n\n## Keeping your National Insurance number safe\n\nTo prevent identity fraud, do not share your National Insurance number with anyone who does not need it.\n\nThese organisations may need to know what your number is:\n\n  * HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)\n  * your employer\n  * the Department for Work and Pensions (which includes Jobcentre Plus and the Pension, Disability and Carers Service), if you claim state benefits, or in Northern Ireland the Department for Social Development\n  * your local council, if you claim Housing Benefit, or the Northern Ireland Housing Executive\n  * Electoral Registration Officers (to check your identity when you register to vote)\n  * the Student Loans Company, if you apply for a student loan\n  * your pension provider if you have a personal or stakeholder pension\n  * your Individual Savings Account (ISA) provider, if you open an ISA\n  * authorised financial service providers who help you buy and sell investments like shares, bonds and derivatives - you can [check if your provider is authorised](https://register.fca.org.uk/)\n  * Veterans UK\n\n## National Insurance classes \n\nThe class you pay depends on your employment status and how much you earn. See the [current rates for Class 1, 2 and 4 contributions](/national-insurance/how-much-you-pay).\n\n## If you\u2019re employed\n\nYour employer will automatically deduct Class 1 contributions from your pay if you\u2019re both:\n\n  * under State Pension age\n  * earning more than \u00a3242 a week from one job\n\n\n\nClass 1A and Class 1B are only paid by employers on their employees\u2019 expenses or benefits.\n\n### If you earn less than \u00a3242 a week from one job\n\nIf you earn from \u00a3123 to \u00a3242 a week from one job, you do not usually pay National Insurance but may still qualify for certain benefits and the State Pension.\n\nIf you earn less than \u00a3123 a week from one job, you can choose to pay voluntary Class 3 contributions to cover [gaps in your National Insurance record](/voluntary-national-insurance-contributions).\n\n## If you\u2019re self-employed\n\nThe class you pay depends on your profits.\n\n### If your profits are \u00a36,725 or more a year\n\nClass 2 contributions are treated as having been paid to protect your National Insurance record. This means you do not have to pay Class 2 contributions.\n\nIf your profits are more than \u00a312,570 a year, you must pay Class 4 contributions.\n\n### If your profits are less than \u00a36,725 a year\n\nYou do not have to pay anything but you can choose to pay voluntary Class 2 contributions to avoid [gaps in your National Insurance record](/voluntary-national-insurance-contributions).\n\n## If you\u2019re not working\n\nYou can choose to pay voluntary Class 3 contributions to cover [gaps in your National Insurance record](/voluntary-national-insurance-contributions).\n\n## How much you pay \n\nThe amount of National Insurance you pay depends on your employment status and how much you earn.\n\nYou can see rates for [past tax years](/government/publications/rates-and-allowances-national-insurance-contributions/rates-and-allowances-national-insurance-contributions).\n\n## If you\u2019re employed\n\nYou pay [Class 1 National Insurance contributions](/national-insurance/national-insurance-classes).\n\nThe Class 1 National Insurance rates for most people for the 2024 to 2025 tax year are:\n\nYour pay | From 6 April 2024 to 5 April 2025  \n---|---  \n\u00a3242 to \u00a3967 a week (\u00a31,048 to \u00a34,189 a month) | 8%  \nOver \u00a3967 a week (\u00a34,189 a month) | 2%  \n  \nYou\u2019ll pay less if:\n\n  * you\u2019re a [married woman or widow](/reduced-national-insurance-married-women) with a valid \u2018certificate of election\u2019\n  * you\u2019re [deferring National Insurance](/defer-self-employed-national-insurance) because you\u2019ve got more than one job\n\n\n\nEmployers pay a different rate of National Insurance depending on their employees\u2019 [category letters](/national-insurance-rates-letters).\n\n### How to pay\n\nYou pay National Insurance with your tax. Your employer will take it from your wages before you get paid. Your payslip will show your contributions.\n\nIf you\u2019re a [director of a limited company](/employee-directors), you may also be your own employee and pay Class 1 National Insurance through your PAYE payroll.\n\n## If you\u2019re self-employed\n\nYou pay [Class 4 National Insurance](/self-employed-national-insurance-rates), depending on your profits. Most people pay through [Self Assessment](/self-assessment-tax-returns).\n\nIf your profits are \u00a36,725 or more, your Class 2 contributions are treated as having been paid to protect your National Insurance record.\n\nYou may be able to [pay voluntary contributions](/voluntary-national-insurance-contributions) to avoid gaps in your National Insurance record if you:\n\n  * have profits of less than \u00a36,725 a year from your self-employment\n  * have a specific job (such as an examiner or business owner in property or land) and you do not pay Class 2 National Insurance through Self Assessment\n\n\n\nIf you have gaps and do not pay voluntary contributions, this may [affect the benefits you can get](/national-insurance/what-national-insurance-is-for), such as the State Pension.\n\nIf you have a specific job and you do not pay Class 2 National Insurance through Self Assessment, you need to [contact HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to arrange a voluntary payment](/contact-hmrc).\n\n## If you\u2019re employed and self-employed\n\nYou might be an employee but also do self-employed work. In this case your employer will deduct your Class 1 National Insurance from your wages, and you may have to pay Class 4 National Insurance for your self-employed work.\n\nHow much you pay depends on your combined wages and your self-employed work. HMRC will let you know how much National Insurance is due after you\u2019ve filed your [Self Assessment](/self-assessment-tax-returns) tax return.\n\n## Directors, landlords and share fishermen\n\nThere are different National Insurance rules if you\u2019re a:\n\n  * [director of a limited company](/employee-directors)\n  * [landlord running a property business](/renting-out-a-property/paying-tax)\n  * [share fisherman](/share-fisherman-income-tax-and-national-insurance-contributions), for example you\u2019re working on a British fishing boat but not under a contract of service\n\n\n\nYou can apply to HMRC to [check your National Insurance record](/check-national-insurance-record) and [claim a refund](/claim-national-insurance-refund) if you think you\u2019ve overpaid.\n\n## What National Insurance is for \n\nNational Insurance contributions count towards the benefits and pensions in the table.\n\n| Class 1: employees | Class 2: self-employed | Class 3: voluntary contributions  \n---|---|---|---  \nBasic State Pension | Yes | Yes | Yes  \nAdditional State Pension | Yes | No | No  \nNew State Pension | Yes | Yes | Yes  \nNew Style Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance | Yes | No | No  \nContribution-based Employment and Support Allowance | Yes | Yes | No  \nMaternity Allowance | Yes | Yes | No  \nBereavement Support Payment | Yes | Yes | No  \n  \nIf you\u2019re self-employed and make a profit of more than \u00a312,570 a year, you pay Class 4 contributions. These do not count towards state benefits or pensions.\n\n## Help if you're not working \n\nYour benefits could be affected if there are gaps in your National Insurance record. [National Insurance credits](/national-insurance-credits) can help to avoid gaps in your record and protect your benefits.\n\nYou can get credits if you cannot pay National Insurance contributions, for example, if:\n\n  * you\u2019re unable to work due to illness\n  * you\u2019re caring for someone\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re not working or getting credits you can also top up your National Insurance with [voluntary contributions](/voluntary-national-insurance-contributions).\n\n## Change of circumstance \n\nYou must tell HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) if you:\n\n  * [change your personal details](/tell-hmrc-change-of-details), for example your name, address or marital status\n  * [start being self-employed](/register-for-self-assessment/self-employed)\n  * [stop being self-employed](/stop-being-self-employed)\n\n\n  *[HMRC]: HM Revenue and Customs\n  *[ISA]: Individual Savings Account\n  *[PAYE]: Pay As You Earn",

It usually takes 2 days to get authorised from when your form is received. Usually, you won\u2019t get a letter confirming the authorisation.\n\nThe Child Benefit Office will also need to have received the claimant\u2019s Child Benefit [claim form](/government/publications/child-benefit-claim-form-ch2).\n\nMore than one person can be authorised but they each must send a TC689 form.\n\n### If you act for a lot of clients\n\nWrite to the [Tax Credit Office](/contact/hm-revenue-customs/tax-credits-enquiries) to register as an \u2018intermediary organisation\u2019 if you work in the voluntary sector and act for many people.\n\nYou can get [urgent authorisation online](https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/tc689?dept-name=&sub-dept-name=&location=43&) if you\u2019re an intermediary organisation and you have a completed TC689.

      "body": "## Overview \n\nIf you owe people money (your \u2018creditors\u2019) you can make arrangements to pay your debts. Your options depend on the amount of money and assets you have.\n\n## Where you can get help\n\nSpeak to a debt adviser to get help choosing the best way to deal with your debt.\n\nMoneyHelper has information about [debt management](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/money-troubles/dealing-with-debt) and [free debt advisory services](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/money-troubles/dealing-with-debt/debt-advice-locator).\n\n## Paying off your debts\n\nYou can pay your debts in instalments by setting up:\n\n  * a [Debt Management Plan](/options-for-paying-off-your-debts/debt-management-plans) which is an agreement with your creditors managed by a financial company\n  * an [Administration Order](/options-for-paying-off-your-debts/administration-orders) when you\u2019ve had a county court judgment (CCJ) or a High Court judgment (HCJ) against you for debts under \u00a35,000\n  * an [Individual Voluntary Arrangement](/options-for-paying-off-your-debts/individual-voluntary-arrangements) which is managed by an insolvency practitioner\n\n\n\nYou can also get temporary protection from your creditors through the [\u2018Breathing Space\u2019 scheme](/options-for-paying-off-your-debts/breathing-space), while still making repayments. You\u2019ll need to apply through a debt advisor.\n\nIn Scotland you can arrange a Debt Payment Programme from the [Debt Arrangement Scheme](https://www.aib.gov.uk/debt-arrangement-scheme).\n\nYou may also have the option of reaching an informal agreement with your creditors.\n\n## If you cannot pay off your debt\n\nYou can apply for a [Debt Relief Order](/options-for-paying-off-your-debts/debt-relief-orders) or [Bankruptcy Order](/becoming-bankrupt/applying-to-become-bankrupt) if you cannot pay your debts because you do not have enough money or assets you can sell.\n\nIf you cannot pay off your debts, you can be [made bankrupt](/becoming-bankrupt/if-someones-applying-to-make-you-bankrupt).\n\n## Breathing Space (Debt Respite Scheme) \n\nIf you live in England or Wales, you can get temporary protection from your creditors while you get debt advice and make a plan. This scheme is called \u2018Breathing Space\u2019.\n\nYou can get temporary protection for up to 60 days.\n\nYou\u2019ll still need to make your debt repayments.\n\nIf you get it:\n\n  * enforcement action cannot be taken against you\n  * your creditors cannot contact you about debts included in your Breathing Space\n  * your creditors cannot add interest or charges to your debt\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re getting mental health crisis treatment, your protection from creditors will be longer. It will last for the length of your treatment, plus another 30 days.\n\n## How to apply for the Breathing Space scheme\n\nTo apply for the \u2018Breathing Space\u2019 scheme, you need to talk to a debt adviser. They will submit an application on your behalf if it\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\nYou can [find a free debt adviser](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/money-troubles/dealing-with-debt/debt-advice-locator) on the MoneyHelper website. You can get confidential advice online, over the phone or in person.\n\nIf you\u2019re receiving mental health treatment and cannot speak to a debt adviser, someone else can do so on your behalf.\n\n## Costs\n\nIt\u2019s free to apply for \u2018Breathing Space\u2019, but some debt advisers may charge you a fee.\n\n## Eligibility\n\nYou must:\n\n  * not have a debt relief order (DRO), an individual voluntary arrangement (IVA), an interim order, or be an undischarged bankrupt at the time you apply\n  * not already be using the \u2018Breathing Space\u2019 scheme\n  * not have used the \u2018Breathing Space\u2019 scheme in the last 12 months, unless it was for a mental health crisis\n\n## Debt Management Plans \n\nA Debt Management Plan is an agreement between you and your creditors to pay all of your debts.\n\nDebt management plans are usually used when either:\n\n  * you can only afford to pay creditors a small amount each month\n  * you have debt problems but will be able to make repayments in a few months\n\n\n\nYou can arrange a plan with your creditors yourself or through a licensed debt management company for a fee. If you arrange this with a company:\n\n  * you make regular payments to the company\n  * the company shares the money out between your creditors\n\n\n\nMoneyHelper has information about [where to get free debt advice](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/money-troubles/dealing-with-debt/debt-advice-locator).\n\n## Get a Debt Management Plan\n\n  1. Set up a plan with a debt management company authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). [Search the Financial Services Register](https://register.fca.org.uk/) for an authorised company.\n\n  2. The company works out your monthly payments. You\u2019ll have to give details about your financial situation, for example your assets, debts, income and creditors.\n\n  3. The company contacts your creditors and asks them to agree to the plan (they do not have to).\n\n\n\n\nUnless stated in the agreement, your creditors can still:\n\n  * ask you to pay your full debt at a later date\n  * take action to recover their money even if you keep up your payments\n\n\n\n## Costs\n\nSome companies will charge:\n\n  * a set up fee\n  * a handling fee each time you make a payment\n\n\n\nMake sure you understand the costs of your plan and how you pay for it.\n\n## Eligibility\n\nDebt Management Plans can only be used to pay \u2018unsecured\u2019 debts, for example debts that have not been guaranteed against your property.\n\n## Your responsibilities\n\nYour plan can be cancelled if you do not keep up your repayments.\n\n## Administration orders \n\nAn administration order is a way to deal with debt if you have a county court or High Court judgment against you and you cannot pay in full.\n\nThe debt must be less than \u00a35,000.\n\nYou make one payment a month to your local court. The court will divide this money between your creditors.\n\nCreditors listed on the administration order cannot take any further action against you without the court\u2019s permission.\n\nMoneyHelper has information about [where to get free debt advice](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/money-troubles/dealing-with-debt/debt-advice-locator).\n\n## Get an administration order\n\nFill in an [application for an administration order (form N92)](/government/publications/form-n92-application-for-an-administration-order) and return it to your local court.\n\nThe court decides:\n\n  * how much of your debt you have to repay, for example all or just part of it\n  * how much your monthly repayments will be\n  * how long the arrangement lasts\n\n\n\nThe arrangement is known as a \u2018composition order\u2019 if you cannot pay all your debts.\n\n## Costs\n\nThere\u2019s a court fee each time you make a payment. This cannot be more than 10% of your debt.\n\n### Example\n\nIf you owe \u00a35,000 the total fee cannot be more than \u00a3500.\n\n## Eligibility\n\nYou must:\n\n  * owe less than \u00a35,000, including any interest and charges\n  * owe money to at least 2 creditors\n  * prove you can afford regular repayments, for example by giving details of your income\n  * have a county court or High Court judgment against you, which you cannot pay in full\n\n\n\n## Your responsibilities\n\nYou must keep up your repayments or the court can:\n\n  * ask your employer to take money from your wages \u2013 known as an \u2018attachment of earnings order\u2019\n  * cancel the arrangement\n\n\n\nYou may still be able to keep your business running, if you have one.\n\n## Public records\n\nYour administration order is added to the Register of Judgments, Orders and Fines.\n\nIt\u2019s usually removed 6 years after the date the order was made.\n\nYour entry is marked as \u2018satisfied\u2019 if you repay your debts in full.\n\nYou can also ask the court for a \u2018certificate of satisfaction\u2019. To do this, write to the court and send a cheque for \u00a318 (made payable to His Majesty\u2019s Courts and Tribunal Service).\n\n## Individual Voluntary Arrangements \n\nAn Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) is an agreement with your creditors to pay all or part of your debts. You agree to make regular payments to an insolvency practitioner, who will divide this money between your creditors.\n\nAn IVA can give you more control of your assets than bankruptcy.\n\nMoneyHelper has information about [where to get free debt advice](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/money-troubles/dealing-with-debt/debt-advice-locator).\n\n## Get an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)\n\nUse an [insolvency practitioner](http://www.insolvencydirect.bis.gov.uk/fip1/) to get an IVA.\n\nYour insolvency practitioner works out what you can afford to repay and how long the IVA lasts. You\u2019ll have to give details about your financial situation, for example your assets, debts, income and creditors.\n\nYour insolvency practitioner will contact your creditors. The IVA will start if the creditors holding 75% of your debts agree to it. It will apply to all your creditors, including any who disagreed to it.\n\nAn IVA will stop your creditors taking action against you for your debts.\n\n## Costs\n\nThere are usually 2 fees:\n\n  * a set up fee\n  * a handling fee each time you make a payment\n\n\n\nMake sure you know how much it\u2019s going to cost before asking an insolvency practitioner to act for you.\n\n## Your responsibilities\n\nYour IVA can be cancelled by the insolvency practitioner if you do not keep up your repayments. The insolvency practitioner can make you bankrupt.\n\nYou may still be able to keep your business running, if you have one.\n\n### Public records\n\nYour IVA will be added to the [Individual Insolvency Register](/search-bankruptcy-insolvency-register). It\u2019s removed 3 months after the IVA ends.\n\n## Debt Relief Orders \n\nDebt Relief Orders (DROs) are one way to deal with your debts if you:\n\n  * owe less than \u00a350,000\n  * do not have much spare income - usually less than \u00a375 per month\n  * do not own your home\n\n\n\nIf you have a DRO, you:\n\n  * stop making payments towards your debts (including interest) for 12 months\n  * need to follow certain rules (\u2018restrictions\u2019) during that time\n  * will not need to pay the debts or follow restrictions after 12 months\n\n\n\nA DRO can be cancelled if your financial circumstances change. It can be extended if you do not follow the restrictions.\n\nYou will still have to pay:\n\n  * your rent and bills\n  * certain debts not included in the DRO, such as student loans or court fines\n\n\n\n## Restrictions\n\nThere are restrictions on what you can do while you have a DRO.\n\nYou cannot:\n\n  * borrow more than \u00a3500 without telling the lender about your DRO\n  * act as the director of a company\n  * create, manage or promote a company without the court\u2019s permission\n  * manage a business without telling those you do business with about your DRO\n  * open a bank account without telling the bank or building society about your DRO\n\n\n\nYou may be prosecuted if you break any of these restrictions while you have a DRO.\n\n## Eligibility\n\nYou\u2019re generally eligible if you meet all of these criteria:\n\n  * you owe less than \u00a350,000\n  * you\u2019ve less than \u00a375 a month spare income\n  * you\u2019ve less than \u00a32,000 worth of assets\n  * you do not own a vehicle worth \u00a34,000 or more\n  * you\u2019ve lived or worked in England and Wales within the last 3 years\n  * you have not applied for a DRO within the last 6 years\n\n\n\n## Get a Debt Relief Order\n\n[Contact an approved debt adviser](/government/publications/getting-a-debt-relief-order) to apply for a DRO. You cannot apply for a DRO on your own.\n\nYou do not need to pay for a DRO.\n\nMoneyHelper has information about [where to get free debt advice](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/money-troubles/dealing-with-debt/debt-advice-locator).\n\n## Records\n\nYour DRO will:\n\n  * be added to the [Individual Insolvency Register](/search-bankruptcy-insolvency-register) \\- it\u2019s removed 3 months after the DRO ends\n  * stay on your credit record for 6 years - this is the same as other debt relief options\n\n\n  *[CCJ]: county court judgment\n  *[HCJ]: High Court judgment\n  *[DRO]: Debt Relief Order\n  *[IVA]: Individual Voluntary Arrangement\n  *[DROs]: Debt Relief Orders",

      "body": "## Overview \n\nYou can [apply for an Advanced Learner Loan](/advanced-learner-loan/how-to-apply) to help with the costs of a course at a college or training provider in England.\n\nLoan eligibility does not depend on your income and there are no credit checks.\n\nCheck [if you\u2019re eligible](/advanced-learner-loan/eligibility) before you apply for an Advanced Learner Loan.\n\nIf you\u2019re studying a level 3 qualification, you might be eligible for an \u2018Adult Education Budget\u2019 grant instead of an Advanced Learner Loan. If you get a grant, you do not need to repay it. Ask your college or training provider about grants before you apply for a loan.\n\nIf someone is claiming an [Adult Dependants\u2019 Grant](/adult-dependants-grant) on your behalf, the amount of money they get could be affected if you successfully apply for an Advanced Learner Loan.\n\nDifferent funding is available if you want to study in Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales. Check:\n\n  * [funding for students in Scotland](https://www.myworldofwork.co.uk/learn-and-train/funding)\n  * [funding for students in Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/information-and-services/adult-learning/financial-help-adult-learners)\n  * [funding for students in Wales](http://www.studentfinancewales.co.uk/fe/wglg-fe.aspx#.VysvcpMrJmB)\n\n\n\n## When you repay your loan\n\nYou\u2019ll have to start [repaying your loan](https://www.gov.uk/repaying-your-student-loan/when-you-start-and-finish-repaying) when your income is over a certain amount (the \u2018threshold\u2019 amount).\n\nYou\u2019ll be charged interest from the day you get the first payment.\n\nYou can choose to make [extra repayments](https://www.gov.uk/repaying-your-student-loan/make-extra-repayments) towards your loan. These are in addition to the repayments you must make when your income is over the threshold amount and are not compulsory.\n\n## Access to Higher Education (HE) course\n\nStudent Finance England will \u2018write off\u2019 any outstanding Advanced Learner Loan balances you owe for an Access to HE course once you complete a higher education course. This means you do not have to repay it.\n\nThe higher education course must be [eligible for student finance](https://www.gov.uk/student-finance/who-qualifies).\n\nIf you made extra repayments towards your Advanced Learner Loan before starting a Higher Education course, these repayments are non-refundable.\n\n## Loan Bursary Fund\n\nYou may also be eligible for money from the Advanced Learner Loan [Bursary Fund](/advanced-learner-loan/bursary-fund) if you need help with some costs while studying, for example childcare, travel or trips related to your course.\n\nUse MoneyHelper to [work out the cost of borrowing](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/everyday-money/credit-and-purchases/how-to-work-out-the-true-cost-of-borrowing).\n\n## What you'll get \n\nHow much you get depends on:\n\n  * the type of course\n  * your course fees\n  * the maximum loan available for your course\n\n\n\nIt only covers your course fees, not your living costs. The minimum loan you can get is \u00a3300 and it\u2019s paid directly to your college or training provider.\n\nYou do not have to borrow the full cost of your course - you can pay for some of it yourself.\n\n## Number of loans you can get\n\nYou can apply for up to 4 loans and you can get more than one at the same time.\n\nYou can apply for another loan to take the same level of a course, for example the same level qualification in History if you\u2019ve already had a loan for the same level in Maths.\n\nYou can only apply once for an Access to Higher Education course.\n\n### A levels\n\nYou can apply for a loan to fund each course you take towards your A levels - up to a maximum of 4 A levels.\n\nThis means you can have up to 8 loans if you\u2019re taking each A level as 2 separate courses.\n\nThe courses must be in the same subject to qualify for a full A level.\n\nYou can get 3 more loans for non A level courses either before or after your course of A levels.\n\n## Eligibility \n\nWhether you qualify for an Advanced Learner Loan depends on your:\n\n  * age\n  * course\n  * college or training provider\n  * nationality or residency status\n\n\n\nYou must be 19 or older on the first day of your course.\n\nYour course must be:\n\n  * a [Level 3, 4, 5 or 6 qualification](/what-different-qualification-levels-mean), for example A levels or graduate certificate\n  * at an approved college or training provider in England\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re studying a level 4 or 5 qualification with Higher Technical Qualification approval, [apply for undergraduate student finance](/apply-for-student-finance) instead.\n\nAsk your college or training provider if you do not know if your course is eligible.\n\n## Your nationality or residency status\n\nIn most cases, all of the following must apply. You must:\n\n  * be living in the UK on the first day of your course\n  * be a UK national or Irish citizen or have \u2018settled status\u2019 (no restrictions on how long you can stay)\n  * have been living in the UK, British overseas territories, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man for 3 years in a row before the first day of your course (apart from temporary absences such as holidays)\n\n\n\nYou may also be eligible if you\u2019re a UK national (or family member of a UK national) who either:\n\n  * returned to the UK on or after 1 January 2018 and by 31 December 2020 after living in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein\n  * was living in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein on 31 December 2020 and has been living in the UK, the EU, Gibraltar, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein for the past 3 years\n\n\n\n### If you or a family member is from the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein\n\nYou may be eligible if you\u2019re:\n\n  * [an EEA national](/eu-eea)\n  * a Swiss national\n  * a family member of an EEA national\n  * a child of a Swiss national\n\n\n\nBoth of the following must also apply:\n\n  * you have settled or pre-settled status under the [EU Settlement Scheme](/settled-status-eu-citizens-families), or are in the process of applying for it\n  * you\u2019ve normally lived in the UK, EU, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, or British or EU overseas territories for the past 3 years (this is also known as being \u2018ordinarily resident\u2019)\n\n\n\nIrish citizens do not need to apply for a visa or to the EU Settlement Scheme to be eligible.\n\n### If you have a different residency status\n\nYou may also be eligible if your residency status is one of the following:\n\n  * a refugee, or the family member of one\n  * a migrant worker or a frontier worker, or a family member of one\n  * you\u2019re not a UK national but you\u2019ve lived in the UK for at least 20 years (or at least half of your life)\n  * you\u2019re the family member of someone with \u2018settled status\u2019 in the UK\n  * under humanitarian protection or a family member of someone who has been granted it\n  * the child of a Turkish worker\n  * staying in the UK as a stateless person, or their family member, and your course started on or after 1 August 2018\n  * granted \u2018Calais leave\u2019 to remain, or the child of someone granted \u2018Calais leave\u2019 to remain - if your course starts on or after 1 August 2020\n  * a serving member of the UK armed forces, or their spouse, civil partner or a dependent parent or child living with them, doing a distance learning course from outside the UK that started on or after 1 August 2017\n  * you, your parent or your step-parent have been given indefinite leave to enter or remain as a victim of domestic violence\n  * you, your parent or your step-parent have been given indefinite leave to remain as a bereaved partner\n  * you or your family member have been granted leave under the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP) or the Afghan Citizen\u2019s Resettlement Scheme (ACRS)\n  * you or your family member have been granted leave to enter or remain in the UK under the Ukraine Family Scheme, the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme or the Ukraine Extension Scheme\n  * you are a Chagossian with British citizenship, or a British citizen who is a direct descendant of a Chagossian\n\n## How to apply \n  1.

      "body": "## Types of complaints \n\nThere are different ways to complain in England depending on whether your child:\n\n  * attends a [state school](/complain-about-school/state-schools)\n  * attends a [private school](/complain-about-school/private-schools)\n  * has [special educational needs](/complain-about-school/sen-complaints) (SEN)\n\n\n\nSchools may not consider complaints about behaviour that happens outside the school\u2019s hours or premises \u2013 check the school\u2019s behaviour policy.\n\nThere are different ways to:\n\n  * [complain about schools in Scotland](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scotland/family/education/school-and-pre-school-education-s/problems-at-school-s/)\n  * [complain about schools in Wales](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/wales/family/education/school-education/problems-at-school/)\n  * [complain about schools in Northern Ireland](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/nireland/family/education/school-education/problems-at-school/#h-dealing-with-a-problem-at-school)\n\n\n\n## Other types of complaint\n\nFor some types of complaint you need to contact a different agency.\n\nComplaint | Who to contact  \n---|---  \nChild protection | [Local council](/report-child-abuse-to-local-council)  \nCriminal behaviour | [Police](/contact-police)  \nData protection | [Information Commissioner\u2019s Office](https://ico.org.uk/concerns/handling/)  \nDiscrimination | [Equality Advisory and Support Service](http://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/app/ask)  \nEmployment | [An employment tribunal](/courts-tribunals/employment-tribunal)  \nExam malpractice or maladministration (SATs) | [Standards and testing agency](/guidance/how-to-report-maladministration-at-key-stage-1-and-key-stage-2)  \nExam malpractice or maladministration (secondary school) |  [Ofqual](/government/organisations/ofqual/about/complaints-procedure) and the awarding body  \n  \n### Report serious teacher misconduct\n\nSerious misconduct is any behaviour that could result in a teacher not being allowed to teach again, such as sexual misconduct or violent behaviour.\n\nYou can [report a teacher for serious misconduct](/report-teacher-misconduct) to the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA).\n\nYou should follow the school\u2019s complaints process before reporting a teacher for serious misconduct. Your report may not be investigated unless you do.\n\n## Legal advice\n\nYou can get free legal advice about schooling and education from [Child Law Advice](http://childlawadvice.org.uk/).\n\n## State schools \n\nState schools include:\n\n  * maintained schools\n\n  * academies and free schools\n\n\n\n\nCall 999 if a child is in immediate danger. Contact your local council or call your local police on 101 if you think a child is at risk.\n\n## Complain to the school\n\nContact the school to discuss the problem first - most problems can be solved this way.\n\nYou can make an informal complaint. The school will tell you when they will respond. After they review your complaint, you\u2019ll be told the outcome.\n\nIf the problem is not resolved, follow the school\u2019s complaints procedure to make a formal complaint.\n\n\u200b\u200bEvery school in England must have one. It\u2019s usually available on the school\u2019s website or from the school office and should tell you the kind of complaints the school deals with.\n\nYou may not be able to complain to academies or free schools if you do not have a child at the school.\n\n## Complain to DfE\n\nYou need to complete the school\u2019s complaints procedure before you complain to DfE, unless one of the following applies:\n\n  * a child is not getting an education\n  * a child has been exposed to harm\n  * the school is stopping you from following its complaints procedure\n\n\n\nDfE will consider your complaint. They may use the information you provide to recommend improvements to school policies.\n\nDfE cannot deal with complaints about:\n\n  * fines for taking holidays in term time (sometimes known as a \u2018fixed penalty notice\u2019)\n\n  * lack of compensation or apologies from the school\n\n  * the behaviour of school staff\n\n\n\n\nIf you have followed all the steps in the school\u2019s complaints procedure and believe your complaint was not dealt with correctly, you can [complain to DfE](/complain-to-dfe).\n\n## Complain to Ofsted\n\nIf you\u2019ve complained to the school and the problem has not been resolved, you can complain to Ofsted. This does not mean that Ofsted will then inspect the school.\n\nThey will record your complaint, and may use the information you\u2019ve provided to help them decide what areas to focus their next inspection on.\n\nOfsted considers complaints about things that affect the whole school rather than individuals.\n\nOfsted cannot:\n\n  * resolve issues between you and the school\n\n  * ask the school to respond directly to your complaint or take action on it\n\n  * change the outcome of a complaint\n\n  * change the school\u2019s complaints process because of a complaint\n\n\n\n\nYou can [complain about a state school to Ofsted](/complain-to-ofsted).\n\n## Private schools \n\n[Contact your local council](/report-child-abuse-to-local-council) or call your local police on 101 if you think a child is at risk.\n\nCall 999 if a child is in immediate danger.\n\n## Make a complaint\n\nFollow the school\u2019s complaints procedure - every school in England must have one. It should be published on the school\u2019s website.\n\nIt should tell you what kind of complaints the school will deal with, such as bullying or bad behaviour.\n\nYou cannot complain directly to a private school if you do not have a child at the school.\n\n### Further complaints\n\nThe Department for Education (DfE) cannot investigate individual complaints about private schools. But it has certain powers as a regulator if the school is not meeting standards set by DfE for:\n\n  * education\n  * pupil welfare and health and safety\n  * school premises\n  * staff suitability\n  * making information available to parents\n  * spiritual, moral, social or cultural development of students\n\n\n\nDfE will consider any reports of a major failure to meet the standards. It can arrange an emergency inspection to look at pupil welfare and health and safety, and make sure serious failings are dealt with.\n\nDfE can ask the school inspectorates to take minor complaints into account when the school is next inspected.\n\nYou can complain to the DfE by filling in the [school complaints form](https://form.education.gov.uk/service/Contact_the_Department_for_Education).\n\n## Special educational needs (SEN) \n\nIf you want to complain about a school\u2019s [SEN support](/children-with-special-educational-needs), you should do it while your child is still registered at the school.\n\nThis includes complaints that the school has not provided the support required by your child\u2019s education, health and care (EHC) plan.\n\nThere\u2019s a different process if you [disagree with a decision your local authority has made about an EHC plan](/appeal-ehc-plan-decision).\n\nBefore making a complaint, talk to the school\u2019s special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) to try and find a solution.\n\nIf the school does not have a SENCO, ask them who you should raise your concerns with.\n\n## If you\u2019re not happy after talking to the school\n\nYou can make a formal complaint to the school.\n\n\u200b\u200bAsk the school or check their website for how to make a formal complaint. They may tell you to raise the complaint with your [local authority](https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council).\n\nCheck if the school has an \u2018SEN Information Report\u2019. This will usually outline how to complain to them about SEN provision.\n\nIf you do not want to make a formal complaint, your local authority may offer a \u2018disagreement resolution service\u2019 that can help resolve your disagreement about SEN support. Contact your [local authority](https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council) or check their website for their \u2018SEND local offer\u2019 for details.\n\n## If the school or local authority cannot solve the problem\n\nYou can [complain to the Department for Education (DfE)](https://form.education.gov.uk/service/Contact_the_Department_for_Education).\n\nThey can ask the school to take action if they find your complaint was not handled correctly.\n\nDfE cannot normally change the decision, but they can look into how it was made and ask the school to take action where appropriate.\n\n## Disability discrimination \n\nFollow the school\u2019s complaints process [if you believe a school has discriminated against someone because of their disability](/rights-disabled-person/education-rights).\n\nIf this does not solve the problem, or you do not want to complain to the school first, you may be able to complain to the Special Educational Needs and Disability (SEND) tribunal.\n\n## Who can complain to the SEND tribunal\n\nYou can complain to the tribunal if you\u2019re:\n\n  * someone with parental responsibility for a young person, or their foster parent or carer\n  * a young person over [school leaving age](/know-when-you-can-leave-school) but under 18\n\n\n\nYou can complain to the tribunal about:\n\n  * a school, nursery or pupil referral unit maintained by a local authority\n  * an independent school\n  * a free school, including an academy\n\n\n\nYou cannot complain to the tribunal about:\n\n  * a private nursery, unless it\u2019s part of a school\n  * a further education college\n  * an organisation using a school\u2019s premises\n\n\n\n## Complain to the SEND tribunal\n\nYou must send your complaint to the tribunal within 6 months of the discrimination taking place. If you send your complaint more than 6 months later, you\u2019ll be asked to explain why.\n\nYour complaint can include events which happened more than 6 months ago, as long as these directly relate to events that have taken place in the last 6 months. The tribunal must be able to treat events as a single complaint about one ongoing issue.\n\nFor example, if your child was permanently excluded from school after a series of fixed-term exclusions which you believe were all because of the child\u2019s disability, the tribunal could treat them as a single complaint.\n\nIt\u2019s free to make a complaint to the SEND tribunal.\n\nDownload and fill in:\n\n  * [form SEND4A](/government/publications/form-send4a-disability-discrimination-claim-by-a-parent) if you\u2019re a parent making a complaint on behalf of a child\n  * [form SEND4B](/government/publications/form-send4b-disability-discrimination-claim-by-young-person) if you\u2019re a young person above [school leaving age](/know-when-you-can-leave-school) making a complaint for yourself\n\n\n\nThe address to send it to is on the form.\n\nYou can include details of up to 5 witnesses who you\u2019d like to bring to the hearing on your form.\n\nContact the tribunal if you have any questions about completing the form. They cannot give you legal advice.\n\n### Special Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal\n\n[sendistqueries@justice.gov.uk](mailto:sendistqueries@justice.gov.uk)  \nTelephone: 0300 303 5857   \nFax: 0870 739 4017   \n[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)\n\n### Help you can get\n\nCheck if you can [get legal aid](/check-legal-aid).\n\nYou can also get free help and advice from:\n\n  * the [Independent Parental Special Education Advice (IPSEA)](https://www.ipsea.org.uk/Pages/Category/service-overview)\n  * your local Parent Partnership Service through the [Information, Advice and Support Services (IASS) Network](https://councilfordisabledchildren.org.uk/information-advice-and-support-services-network)\n\n\n\nInformation, Advice and Support Services (IASS) Network  \n[iassn@ncb.org.uk](mailto:iassn@ncb.org.uk)\n\n## After you make your complaint\n\nOnce the tribunal has registered your complaint, it will ask you and the school you\u2019re complaining about if you agree to the complaint being decided without a hearing.\n\nIf you both agree, the tribunal will make a decision about your complaint.\n\nIf you do not agree, the tribunal will send you a letter telling you if they\u2019ll hold a hearing, and when and where it\u2019ll take place.\n\nYou can [complain to the Department for Education](https://form.education.gov.uk/service/Contact_the_Department_for_Education) (DfE) about a school if the SEND tribunal will not handle your case.\n\n## Attending the hearing\n\nYou may be able to attend the hearing by video link. If you do need to attend in person, the hearing will be close to your home.\n\n### Change or withdraw your complaint before the hearing\n\nDownload and fill in:\n\n  * [form SEND7](/government/publications/form-send7-request-for-change) to change your complaint, for example to ask for a different hearing date or add more witnesses\n  * [form SEND8](/government/publications/form-send8-withdrawal-of-appeal-or-claim) to withdraw your complaint\n\n\n\n### What happens at the hearing\n\nThe hearing will usually be attended by:\n\n  * a judge and 1 or 2 other tribunal members\n  * a clerk\n  * someone representing the school or local authority you\u2019re complaining about\n  * witnesses\n\n\n\nYou do not have to go to the hearing, but if you do you can ask questions and present the case yourself.

[You may also be eligible](/guardians-allowance/eligibility) if there\u2019s one surviving parent.\n\nThis guide is also available [in Welsh (Cymraeg)](/lwfans-gwarcheidwad).\n\nThe [Guardian\u2019s Allowance rate](/guardians-allowance/what-youll-get) is \u00a321.75 a week. You get it on top of [Child Benefit](/child-benefit) and it\u2019s tax-free.\n\nYou must tell the Guardian\u2019s Allowance Unit about certain [changes to your circumstances](/guardians-allowance/further-information).\n\n## What you'll get \n\nThe Guardian Allowance rate is:\n\n  * \u00a321.75 a week per child\n  * tax-free\n  * paid on top of your [Child Benefit](/child-benefit) payments\n\n\n\n## How the money is paid\n\nUsually, the money is paid into a [bank account](/how-to-have-your-benefits-paid) every 4 weeks. It can be paid weekly if you\u2019re a single parent or getting certain other benefits, such as Income Support.\n\nYou can get the money paid into any account, apart from a Nationwide Building Society account in someone else\u2019s name.\n\n## Effect on other benefits\n\nGuardian\u2019s Allowance does not count as income if you\u2019re claiming tax credits, Income Support, income-based Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance or income-related Employment and Support Allowance.\n\nGuardian\u2019s Allowance is not affected by the [High Income Child Benefit charge](/child-benefit-tax-charge/overview). If you decide not to be paid Child Benefit your Guardian\u2019s Allowance can continue.\n\nGuardian\u2019s Allowance does not count towards the [benefit cap](/benefit-cap/benefits-included-in-the-cap).\n\nUse a [benefits calculator](/benefits-calculators) to work out what benefits you can get.\n\n## Eligibility \n\nTo get Guardian\u2019s Allowance all of the following must apply:\n\n  * you\u2019re bringing up someone else\u2019s child\n  * the child\u2019s parents are dead (see conditions for one surviving parent below)\n  * you qualify for [Child Benefit](/child-benefit)\n\n\n\nOne of the parents must also have been either:\n\n  * born in the UK or a European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland\n  * living in the UK since the age of 16 for at least 52 weeks in any 2-year period\n\n\n\nIf you adopt a child you may still get Guardian\u2019s Allowance as long as you were getting it before you adopted the child.\n\n## If there is one surviving parent\n\nYou could get Guardian\u2019s Allowance if one of the following is true:\n\n  * you do not know where the surviving parent is and you\u2019ve made a reasonable effort to contact them\n  * the parents were divorced or their civil partnership had ended (\u2018dissolved\u2019), the surviving parent does not have custody and is not maintaining the child and there is not a court order in place saying they should\n  * the parents were not married, the mother has died and the father is unknown\n  * the surviving parent will be in prison for at least 2 years from the date of death of the other parent\n  * the surviving parent is in a hospital by court order\n\n\n\nUse a [benefits calculator](/benefits-calculators) to check the benefits you\u2019re entitled to.\n\n## How to claim \n\nTo avoid losing money, claim Guardian\u2019s Allowance as soon as the child comes to live with you.\n\n  1. Fill in the [claim form (BG1)](/government/publications/guardians-allowance-claim-form-bg1).\n\n  2. Send it to [the Guardian\u2019s Allowance Unit](/contact/hm-revenue-customs/guardians-allowance-helpline) with the child\u2019s full birth certificate and the parents\u2019 death certificates (or certificate if one parent has died) - send originals.\n\n\n\n\nYou should also [claim Child Benefit](/child-benefit/how-to-claim) as soon as possible.\n\nGuardian\u2019s Allowance can be backdated for up to 3 months.\n\nYou can also call [the Guardian\u2019s Allowance Unit](/contact/hm-revenue-customs/guardians-allowance-helpline) and ask for a claim pack.\n\n## If you disagree with a decision\n\nYou can [challenge a decision](/mandatory-reconsideration) about your claim. This is called asking for mandatory reconsideration.\n\n## Changes to your circumstances \n\nIf your circumstances change, your entitlement to Guardian\u2019s Allowance could be affected or your payments could stop.\n\nYou must report the following changes straight away:\n\n  * the child goes to live with someone else\n  * you go abroad, either temporarily (for more than 8 weeks) or permanently (for more than 1 year)\n  * the child leaves full-time education or approved training\n  * your bank or contact details change\n  * you find out where the surviving parent is\n  * the surviving parent comes out of hospital or prison (or has their sentence shortened)\n  * the surviving parent makes a payment towards their child\u2019s upkeep\n\n\n\nYou can [report these changes by phone or post](/contact/hm-revenue-customs/guardians-allowance-helpline).",

      "body": "## Overview \n\nAll employees have an employment contract with their employer. A contract is an agreement that sets out an employee\u2019s:\n\n  * employment conditions\n  * rights\n  * responsibilities\n  * duties\n\n\n\nThese are called the \u2018terms\u2019 of the contract.\n\nEmployees and employers must stick to a contract until it ends (for example, by an employer or employee giving notice or an employee being dismissed) or until the terms are changed (usually by agreement between the employee and employer).\n\nIf a person has an agreement to do some work for someone (like paint their house), this is not an employment contract but a \u2018contract to provide services\u2019.\n\n[Find out more about employment contracts](https://www.acas.org.uk/employment-contracts) on the Acas (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service) website.\n\n## Accepting a contract\n\nAs soon as someone accepts a job offer they have a contract with their employer. An employment contract does not have to be written down.\n\n## Contract terms \n\nThe legal parts of a contract are known as \u2018terms\u2019. An employer should make clear which parts of a contract are legally binding.\n\nContract terms could be:\n\n  * in a written contract, or similar document like a written statement of employment\n  * verbally agreed\n  * in an employee handbook or on a company notice board\n  * in an offer letter from the employer\n  * required by law (for example, an employer must pay employees at least the National Minimum Wage)\n  * in [collective agreements](/employment-contracts-and-conditions/collective-agreements) \\- negotiated agreements between employers and trade unions or staff associations\n  * implied terms - automatically part of a contract even if they\u2019re not written down\n\n\n\n## Implied terms\n\nIf there\u2019s nothing clearly agreed between you and your employer about a particular issue, it may be covered by an implied term - for example:\n\n  * employees not stealing from their employer\n  * your employer providing a safe and secure working environment\n  * a legal requirement like the right to a minimum of 5.6 weeks\u2019 paid holidays\n  * something necessary to do the job like a driver having a valid licence\n  * something that\u2019s been done regularly in a company over a long time like paying a Christmas bonus\n\n## Collective agreements \n\nAn employer may have an agreement with employees\u2019 representatives (from trade unions or staff associations) that allows negotiations of terms and conditions like pay or working hours. This is called a collective agreement.\n\nThe terms of the agreement could include:\n\n  * how negotiations will be organised\n  * who will represent employees\n  * which employees are covered by the agreement\n  * which terms and conditions the agreement will cover\n\n## Written statement of employment particulars \n\nAn employer must give [employees and workers](/employment-status) a document stating the main conditions of employment when they start work. This is known as a \u2018written statement of employment particulars\u2019. It is not an employment contract.\n\nThe written statement is made up of:\n\n  * the main document (known as a \u2018principal statement\u2019)\n  * a wider written statement\n\n\n\nThe employer must provide the principal statement on the first day of employment and the wider written statement within 2 months of the start of employment.\n\nEmployers must tell employees or workers about any changes to the written statement. They must do this within one month of making the change.\n\nThere are special rules for agencies on documents that they need to provide to [agency workers](/agency-workers-your-rights/basic-information-you-should-receive).\n\n## The principal statement\n\nThe principal statement must include at least:\n\n  * the employer\u2019s name\n  * the employee\u2019s or worker\u2019s name, job title or a description of work and start date\n  * how much and how often an employee or worker will get paid\n  * hours and days of work and if and how they may vary (also if employees or workers will have to work [on Sundays](/sunday-working), [during the \u2018night period\u2019](/night-working-hours) or [take overtime](/overtime-your-rights/overview))\n  * [holiday entitlement](/holiday-entitlement-rights) (and if that includes public holidays)\n  * where an employee or worker will be working and [whether they might have to relocate](/employer-relocation-your-rights)\n  * if an employee or worker works in different places, where these will be and what the employer\u2019s address is\n  * how long a job is expected to last (and what the end date is if it\u2019s a fixed-term contract)\n  * how long any probation period is and what its conditions are\n  * any other benefits (for example, childcare vouchers and lunch)\n  * obligatory training, whether or not this is paid for by the employer\n\n\n\nFor employees, it must also include the date that a previous job started if it counts towards a period of continuous employment.\n\n### Working abroad\n\nIf an employee or worker has to work outside the UK for more than a month, the principal statement must also include:\n\n  * how long they\u2019ll be abroad\n  * what currency they\u2019ll be paid in\n  * what additional pay or benefits they\u2019ll get\n  * terms relating to their return to the UK\n\n\n\n### Other information the employer must give on day one\n\nOn the first day of employment the employer must also provide the employee or worker with information about:\n\n  * sick pay and procedures\n  * other paid leave (for example, maternity leave and paternity leave)\n  * notice periods\n\n\n\nThe employer can choose whether to include this information in the principal statement or provide it in a separate document. If they provide it in a separate document, this must be something that the employee or worker has reasonable access to, such as on the employer\u2019s intranet.\n\n## The wider written statement\n\nEmployers must give employees and workers a wider written statement within 2 months of the start of employment. This must include information about:\n\n  * pensions and pension schemes\n  * [collective agreements](/employment-contracts-and-conditions/collective-agreements)\n  * any other right to non-compulsory training provided by the employer\n  * disciplinary and grievance procedures\n\n## Problems with a written statement \n\nIf an employee or worker has a problem receiving their written statement, they can:\n\n  1. Try to solve the problem with their employer informally.\n\n  2. If this does not work, [take out a grievance](/raise-grievance-at-work) against their employer (employers can also get advice about handling grievances).\n\n  3. Take a case to an [employment tribunal](/employment-tribunals/taking-a-case-to-an-employment-tribunal) as a last resort.\n\n\n\n\nThe tribunal will decide what the employment particulars in the statement should have been.\n\n## Compensation\n\nIf an employee or worker wins a case about another issue (for example, unauthorised deductions from their wage slip), the tribunal may award compensation if there\u2019s been a problem with their written statement as well.\n\nCompensation can be up to 4 weeks\u2019 pay although there\u2019s a limit on how much a tribunal will award for a week\u2019s pay.\n  *[Acas]: Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service",

You\u2019ll also get different [National Insurance credits](/national-insurance-credits) which count towards your State Pension and help you qualify for other benefits.\n\n[Check if you\u2019re eligible for Universal Credit](https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/eligibility).\n\n## If your Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) is due to end\n\nYou can apply for New Style ESA up to 3 months before your SSP ends. You\u2019ll start getting New Style ESA as soon as your SSP ends.\n\n## If you\u2019re working\n\nYou can apply whether you\u2019re in or out of work. [There are conditions to working while claiming ESA](/employment-support-allowance/working-while-you-claim).\n\n## What you'll get \n\nHow much you get will depend on what stage your application is at, as well as things like your age and whether you\u2019re able to get back into work.\n\nIf you get New Style ESA you\u2019ll earn Class 1 [National Insurance credits](/national-insurance-credits), which can help towards your State Pension and some benefits in the future.\n\n## What might affect how much you get paid\n\n### If you get New Style ESA\n\nYour payments will be affected if you get more than \u00a385 a week from a private pension. If you do, half of your private pension income over \u00a385 will be subtracted from your ESA payments each week.\n\nFor example, if you get \u00a3100 a week from a private pension, then \u00a37.50 will be subtracted from your ESA payment each week.\n\nIf your private pension income is high enough, you could get no ESA payments. You would still get Class 1 National Insurance credits.\n\n### If you get income-related ESA\n\nYou cannot make a new claim for income-related ESA. You\u2019ll continue to get payments while you\u2019re eligible until your claim ends.\n\nYour household income and savings worth \u00a36,000 or more may affect how much you can get.\n\n## While your claim is being assessed\n\nYou\u2019ll normally get the \u2018assessment rate\u2019 for 13 weeks while your claim is being assessed.\n\nThis will be:\n\n  * up to \u00a371.70 a week if you\u2019re aged under 25\n  * up to \u00a390.50 a week if you\u2019re aged 25 or over\n\n\n\nIf it takes longer than 13 weeks to assess your claim, you\u2019ll continue getting the \u2018assessment rate\u2019 until you get a decision or until your ESA is due to end.\n\nYour ESA will be backdated if you\u2019re owed any money after 13 weeks.\n\n## After you\u2019re assessed\n\nYou\u2019ll be placed into one of 2 groups if you\u2019re entitled to ESA. If you\u2019re able to get back into work in the future, you\u2019ll be put into the work-related activity group. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be put into the support group.\n\nYou\u2019ll get:\n\n  * up to \u00a390.50 a week if you\u2019re in the work-related activity group\n  * up to \u00a3138.20 a week if you\u2019re in the support group\n\n\n\n### If you\u2019re in the support group\n\nIf you\u2019re in the support group and on income-related ESA, you\u2019re also entitled to the enhanced disability premium.\n\nYou may also qualify for the severe disability premium.\n\nFind out how to [apply for a disability premium](/disability-premiums).\n\n## How and when you\u2019re paid\n\nYou\u2019ll get paid ESA every 2 weeks.\n\n[Find out how and when your benefits are paid](/how-to-have-your-benefits-paid).\n\n## Other benefits you can claim\n\nYou could get Universal Credit at the same time or instead of New Style ESA. [Check if you\u2019re eligible for Universal Credit](https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/eligibility).\n\nUse a [benefits calculator](/benefits-calculators) to find out what other benefits you could get, for example Personal Independence Payment (PIP) if you have a long-term health condition or disability.\n\nThe [benefit cap](/benefit-cap) may affect the total amount of benefit you can get. The cap will not affect you if you\u2019re in the support group.\n\n## If you\u2019re moving to Universal Credit from income-related ESA\n\nIf your income-related ESA claim is ending because you\u2019re making a new claim for Universal Credit, you\u2019ll automatically continue to get the amount of ESA you currently receive, as long as you\u2019re still eligible. You\u2019ll normally get this for 2 weeks, starting from the date of your new claim.\n\nThe Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will write to you telling you how this works.\n\nYou do not need to pay this money back, and it will not affect the amount of Universal Credit you get.\n\n## Budgeting Loan\n\nYou can apply for a [Budgeting Loan](/budgeting-help-benefits/eligibility) if you\u2019ve been on income-related ESA for at least 6 months.\n\n## Advice on money and debt\n\nYou can get help and advice from your Jobcentre Plus work coach or:\n\n  * [Citizens Advice](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/)\n  * [Money Helper](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en)\n  * [National Debtline](https://www.nationaldebtline.org/)\n  * [Shelter](https://www.shelter.org.uk/)\n  * [Turn2us](https://www.turn2us.org.uk/)\n\n## Working while you claim \n\nYou can usually work while you are claiming ESA if both of the following apply:\n\n  * you work less than 16 hours a week\n  * you do not earn more than \u00a3183.50 a week\n\n\n\nYou can do as many hours of voluntary work as you like.\n\nTell Jobcentre Plus about your work including any volunteering when you make a claim.\n\nIf you\u2019re already claiming ESA and want to start work, [fill in the ESA permitted work form](/government/publications/employment-and-support-allowance-permitted-work-form). Send the form to Jobcentre Plus.\n\n## How to claim \n\nYou could get Universal Credit at the same time or instead of New Style ESA. [Check if you\u2019re eligible for Universal Credit](/universal-credit/eligibility).\n\nThere\u2019s a different way to [apply in Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/employment-and-support-allowance-people-with-disabilities).\n\n## What you need to apply\n\nYou\u2019ll need:\n\n  * your National Insurance number\n  * your bank or building society account number and sort code (you can use a friend or family member\u2019s account if you do not have one)\n  * your doctor\u2019s name, address and telephone number\n  * a [fit note](/taking-sick-leave) (sometimes called a \u2018sick note\u2019 or a \u2018statement of fitness for work\u2019) if you\u2019ve not been able to work for more than 7 days in a row because of a disability or health condition\n  * details of your income, if you\u2019re working\n  * the date your Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) ends, if you\u2019re claiming it\n\n\n\nYou cannot get New Style ESA if you\u2019re getting Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) from an employer. You can apply for New Style ESA up to 3 months before your SSP ends.\n\n## Apply online for ESA\n\nOnce you\u2019ve applied, you\u2019ll be contacted by phone and told when to give the evidence and where to send it.\n\nYou cannot apply online if you\u2019re applying as [an appointee](/become-appointee-for-someone-claiming-benefits) on someone else\u2019s behalf.\n\n[ Apply now ](https://www.apply-new-style-employment-support-allowance.service.gov.uk/)\n\n## When you can apply by phone\n\nCall the Jobcentre Plus new claims helpline if:\n\n  * you cannot make an application online\n  * you\u2019re an appointee for someone\n\n\n\n### Jobcentre Plus new claims helpline\n\nTelephone: 0800 055 6688  \nTextphone: 0800 328 1344  \n[Relay UK](https://www.relayuk.bt.com) (if you cannot hear or speak on the phone): 18001 then 0800 055 6688  \nBritish Sign Language (BSL) [video relay service](https://connect.interpreterslive.co.uk/vrs?ilc=DWP) if you\u2019re on a computer - find out how to [use the service on mobile or tablet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oELNMfAvDxw)  \nWelsh language telephone: 0800 328 1744  \nMonday to Friday, 8am to 5pm  \n[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)\n\n## After you apply\n\nThe Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will contact you within 10 working days of applying.\n\n### If you\u2019re eligible\n\nDWP will contact you within 10 working days to schedule an appointment that you must attend. It will normally be over the phone with a work coach from your local Jobcentre Plus office. If your appointment is in-person at a Jobcentre Plus office, you\u2019ll need to bring [ID and proof of address](/jobcentre-plus-interview).\n\nYour work coach will explain what you need to do to get New Style ESA. They will create an agreement with you called a \u2018Claimant Commitment\u2019.\n\nYou must agree to your Claimant Commitment before you can get New Style ESA.\n\nAt the appointment, you\u2019ll be asked to:\n\n  * explain how your illness or disability affects your ability to work\n  * provide medical evidence\n  * agree to [tell your local Jobcentre Plus if your circumstances change](/employment-support-allowance/change-of-circumstances)\n\n\n\nIf a medical professional has said you might have 12 months or less to live, you will not need to attend an appointment or make a Claimant Commitment. Find out more about [getting benefits if you\u2019re nearing the end of life](/benefits-end-of-life).\n\n### If you\u2019re not eligible\n\nDWP will send you a letter within 10 working days of applying to explain why you\u2019re not eligible for ESA.\n\n## If you disagree with a decision\n\nYou can [challenge a decision](/mandatory-reconsideration) about your claim. This is called asking for \u2018mandatory reconsideration\u2019.\n\n## Reapplying for ESA\n\nYou cannot make a new claim for income-related ESA. You\u2019ll continue to get payments while you\u2019re eligible until your claim ends.\n\nYou may be able to reapply after your New Style ESA ends. You may qualify again depending on:\n\n  * what National Insurance contributions you paid in the last 2 full tax years before the tax year you\u2019re claiming in\n  * whether you\u2019re placed in the support group because you developed a new condition or your health deteriorated\n\n## Your ESA claim \n\nAfter you\u2019ve made your claim, you\u2019ll be told if you need to have a \u2018Work Capability Assessment\u2019 and what group you\u2019ll be put in.\n\n## Work Capability Assessment\n\nA Work Capability Assessment is used to find out if your illness or disability affects how much you can work.\n\nYou might not need one, for example if you\u2019re in hospital or a medical professional has said you might have 12 months or less to live.\n\nIf you need a Work Capability Assessment you\u2019ll get a letter telling you to fill in the [\u2018Capability for work questionnaire\u2019](/government/publications/capability-for-work-questionnaire) and send it to the Health Assessment Advisory Service. The address is on the form. There is a [different questionnaire in Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/publications/capability-work-questionnaire-esa50).\n\nYou\u2019ll be told what happens next, for example if you need an appointment to understand your health condition better.\n\nIf you\u2019re claiming both Universal Credit and New Style ESA, you\u2019ll only have one Work Capability Assessment.\n\nYou can ask for your assessment to be recorded. If you would like this, tell the Health Assessment Advisory Service using the contact details in your appointment invite letter.\n\n## How the assessment happens\n\nAssessments can be in person, by video call or on the phone. You\u2019ll be told how your assessment will take place.\n\nYou can have someone else with you at the assessment, such as a friend or support worker. If your assessment is by phone or video call, you can ask the assessor to call them if they\u2019re not with you when the assessment starts.\n\nYou\u2019ll stay on the \u2018assessment rate\u2019 until a decision can be made on your Work Capability Assessment.\n\n## After your claim is assessed\n\nIf you\u2019re entitled to ESA you\u2019ll be placed in one of 2 groups:\n\n  * a work-related activity group (you cannot work now, but can prepare to work in the future, for example by writing a CV)\n  * a support group (you cannot work now and you\u2019re not expected to prepare for work in the future)\n\n\n\nYou will:\n\n  * usually be in the support group if your illness or disability severely limits what you can do\n  * be in the support group if a medical professional has said you might have 12 months or less to live\n\n\n\n### If you\u2019re in the work-related activity group\n\nYou must attend regular interviews with a work coach. They can help you improve your skills or write a CV to help you get back into work.\n\n### If you\u2019re in the support group\n\nYou do not have to go to interviews. You can tell your work coach if you\u2019d like to take part in work-related activities.\n\n## How long you\u2019ll get ESA for\n\nYou cannot make a new claim for income-related ESA. You\u2019ll continue to get payments while you\u2019re eligible until your claim ends.\n\nNew Style and contribution-based ESA last for 365 days if you\u2019re in the work-related activity group.\n\nThere\u2019s no time limit if you\u2019re in the support group, or if you\u2019re getting income-related ESA.\n\nTo keep getting ESA you must report any [change in your circumstances](/employment-support-allowance/change-of-circumstances). You may also need to [send fit notes](/send-fit-note) regularly.\n\n## If you get a sanction\n\nYour ESA can be reduced if you do not attend interviews or do work-related activity as agreed with your work coach in your \u2018Claimant Commitment\u2019. This reduction can continue for up to 4 weeks after you restart work-related activities.\n\nYou\u2019ll get a letter to say you may be sanctioned. Tell your work coach if you have a good reason for not doing what was agreed in your Claimant Commitment.\n\nYou\u2019ll get another letter if the decision is made to give you a sanction. Your benefit will only be affected once a decision has been made.\n\nYou should [contact your local council](/find-local-council) immediately if you claim Housing Benefit or Council Tax Reduction. They\u2019ll tell you what to do to continue getting support.\n\nIf you get a sanction you can:\n\n  * [ask for the decision to be looked at again](/appeal-benefit-decision)\n  * ask for a hardship payment\n\n\n\nYou will not get a sanction if you\u2019re in the support group.\n\n## Hardship payments\n\nIf you get income-related ESA, you may be able to get a hardship payment if your benefit has been reduced because of a sanction or a [penalty due to suspected benefit fraud](/benefit-fraud).\n\nA hardship payment is a reduced amount of your ESA. You do not have to pay it back.\n\nYou can get a hardship payment if you cannot pay for rent, heating, food or other basic needs for you or your family. You must be 18 or over.\n\nSpeak to your [Jobcentre Plus adviser](/contact-jobcentre-plus/existing-benefit-claims) or work coach to find out how to claim a hardship payment.\n\n## Report a change of circumstances \n\nYou must report changes to your circumstances so you keep getting the right amount of ESA. The amount you get could go up or down.\n\nYour benefit might be stopped or reduced if you do not report a change straight away.\n\nYou may also need to report changes to other organisations paying you benefits. [Find out how to report a change of circumstances for other benefits](/report-benefits-change-circumstances).\n\n## What you need to report\n\nThis list does not cover every change you must report. Call Jobcentre Plus if you\u2019re not sure whether you need to report a change.\n\nYou may be prosecuted or have to pay a \u00a350 penalty if you give wrong or incomplete information.\n\n### Changes to personal details\n\nYou must report if you:\n\n  * change your bank details\n  * change your telephone number\n  * have someone start or stop living with you\n\n\n\nYou must report if you or anyone who lives with you has a change in immigration status, if you or they are not a British citizen.\n\nYou must report if you, anyone who lives with you, or your husband, wife or civil partner:\n\n  * changes name\n  * changes address\n  * leaves Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) for any period of time\n  * gets married or forms a civil partnership\n  * gets divorced or ends a civil partnership\n  * has a baby or gets pregnant\n  * goes into prison or legal custody\n\n\n\nIf anyone who lives with you or your husband, wife or civil partner dies, report this using the [Tell Us Once service](/after-a-death/organisations-you-need-to-contact-and-tell-us-once) instead.\n\n### Changes to a medical condition or disability\n\nYou must report if you or someone included on your claim:\n\n  * has any changes to a medical condition or disability\n  * goes into hospital, a care home or sheltered accommodation\n  * changes doctor\n  * starts or stops caring for someone\n\n\n\n### Changes to work or education\n\nYou must report if you, anyone who lives with you, or your husband, wife or civil partner:\n\n  * starts or stops education, training or an apprenticeship\n  * finds or leaves a job, or starts working different hours\n  * is involved in a trade dispute, or is unable to work because of a trade dispute (for example, if there\u2019s a strike)\n\n\n\n### Changes to income and benefits\n\nYou must report if you or anyone who lives with you:\n\n  * has a change to their salary or earnings from work\n  * gets paid back-pay (sometimes called \u2018arrears\u2019) for their salary or earnings from work\n  * starts or stops getting a benefit or a pension\n  * starts or stops getting any other regular source of money (for example, student loans or grants, sick pay, or money from a charity)\n  * has a change to the amount of money they get from a benefit, a pension or any other regular source of money\n\n\n\nYou must also report if anyone caring for you starts or stops getting:\n\n  * Carer\u2019s Allowance\n  * Carer Support Payment\n  * the carer element of Universal Credit\n\n\n\n### Changes to assets\n\nAssets are things like:\n\n  * savings or investments\n  * property\n  * one-off payments (for example, money from inheritance or a lump sum payment)\n\n\n\nYou must report if you and anyone who lives with you starts or stops having \u00a36,000 or more in total assets between you.\n\nIf you already have over \u00a36,000 in total assets between you, you must report any increase or decrease to the value of those assets.\n\n## If you\u2019ve been paid too much\n\nIf you give wrong or incomplete information or do not report a change straight away, you might be paid too much.

      "body": "## Benefits affected by the cap \n\nThe benefit cap is a limit on the total amount of benefit you can get. It applies to most people aged 16 or over who have not reached [State Pension age](/state-pension-age).\n\nThis guide is also available [in Welsh (Cymraeg)](/cap-ar-fudd-daliadau).\n\nThe benefit cap affects:\n\n  * Universal Credit\n  * Bereavement Allowance\n  * Child Benefit\n  * Child Tax Credit\n  * Employment and Support Allowance\n  * Housing Benefit\n  * Incapacity Benefit\n  * Income Support\n  * Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance\n  * Maternity Allowance\n  * Severe Disablement Allowance\n  * Widowed Parent\u2019s Allowance (or Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance or Widow\u2019s Pension if you started getting it before 9 April 2001)\n\n\n\nYou might [not be affected by the benefit cap](/benefit-cap/when-youre-not-affected) if you get certain benefits or you\u2019re over State Pension age.\n\nIf you\u2019re claiming Universal Credit the [benefit cap might not start for 9 months](/benefit-cap/how-earnings-affect-when-benefit-cap-starts), depending on your earnings.\n\n## When you're not affected \n\nYou\u2019re not affected by the cap if you\u2019re over [State Pension age](/state-pension-age). If you\u2019re part of a couple and one of you is under State Pension age, the cap may apply.\n\nYou\u2019re not affected by the cap if you or your partner:\n\n  * get [Working Tax Credit](https://www.gov.uk/working-tax-credit/eligibility) (even if the amount you get is \u00a30)\n  * get Universal Credit because of a disability or health condition that stops you from working (this is called \u2018limited capability for work and work-related activity\u2019)\n  * get Universal Credit because you care for someone with a disability\n  * get Universal Credit and you and your partner earn \u00a3793 or more a month combined, after tax and National Insurance contributions\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re also not affected by the cap if you, your partner or any children under 18 living with you gets:\n\n  * Adult Disability Payment (ADP)\n  * Armed Forces Compensation Scheme\n  * Armed Forces Independence Payment\n  * Attendance Allowance\n  * Carer\u2019s Allowance\n  * Carer Support Payment\n  * Child Disability Payment\n  * Disability Living Allowance (DLA)\n  * Employment and Support Allowance (if you get the support component)\n  * Guardian\u2019s Allowance\n  * Industrial Injuries Benefits (and equivalent payments as part of a War Disablement Pension or the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme)\n  * Pension Age Disability Payment\n  * Personal Independence Payment (PIP)\n  * War pensions\n  * War Widow\u2019s or War Widower\u2019s Pension\n\n\n\nIf you are affected, the [benefit cap might not start for 9 months](/benefit-cap/how-earnings-affect-when-benefit-cap-starts) \\- depending on your earnings.\n\n## When the benefit cap affects your Universal Credit payments \n\nThe benefit cap might not affect your Universal Credit payments for up to 9 months. This is called the \u2018grace period\u2019.\n\nYou\u2019ll get the grace period if all of the following are true:\n\n  * you\u2019re claiming Universal Credit because you stopped working or your earnings went down\n  * you\u2019re now earning less than \u00a3793 a month\n  * in each of the 12 months before your earnings went down or you stopped working, you earned the same as or more than the earnings threshold (this was \u00a3722 up to 7 April 2024 and is \u00a3793 from 8 April 2024)\n\n\n\nYour partner\u2019s earnings will be included when working out how much you earned even if they\u2019re not claiming benefits. If you have separated from your partner, their earnings will be included for the time that you lived with them before you separated.\n\nYou need to report your last 12 months\u2019 earnings when you [apply for Universal Credit](/universal-credit/how-to-claim) to get the grace period.\n\nYou will [not be affected by the benefit cap](/benefit-cap/when-youre-not-affected) if you or your partner get Universal Credit because you have a disability or health condition or because you care for someone with a disability or you earn \u00a3793 or more between you.\n\n## How the 9 month grace period works\n\nIf you\u2019re already claiming Universal Credit, the grace period will start on the first day of the assessment period in which your earnings went below the earnings threshold. The threshold was \u00a3722 up to 7 April 2024 and is \u00a3793 from 8 April 2024.\n\nIf you\u2019re making a new claim for Universal Credit, the grace period starts from either:\n\n  * the day after the last day you worked\n  * the payday when your earnings went below the earnings threshold (this was \u00a3722 up to 7 April 2024 and is \u00a3793 from 8 April 2024)\n\n\n\nThe 9 month grace period continues if you stop claiming Universal Credit and then start again.\n\nExample\n\nYour 9 month grace period starts on 1 February.\n\nYou get a job on 1 May and your benefit stops. You stop work and claim again from 1 August.\n\nYour 9 month grace period will end on 31 October.\n\nAfter the 9 month grace period ends, the amount of Universal Credit you get will usually go down. It might not go down if your circumstances change and you are [not affected by the benefit cap](/benefit-cap/when-youre-not-affected).\n\n## Help if you're affected by the benefit cap \n\nContact the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) if you\u2019re affected by the benefit cap and you need help.\n\nIf you need help paying your rent or a rent deposit, contact your [local council](/find-local-council) as well. They can check if you\u2019re eligible for a [discretionary housing payment](/government/publications/claiming-discretionary-housing-payments/claiming-discretionary-housing-payments), which is not affected by the benefit cap.\n\n## If you get Universal Credit\n\nContact DWP either:\n\n  * through the journal in your [online account](/sign-in-universal-credit)\n  * by calling the [Universal Credit helpline](/universal-credit/contact-universal-credit)\n\n\n\n## If you get any other benefits\n\nBenefit cap helpline if you do not get Universal Credit  \nTelephone: 0800 169 0145   \nTelephone (Welsh): 0800 169 0238  \nTextphone: 0800 169 0314   \n[Relay UK](https://www.relayuk.bt.com/) (if you cannot hear or speak on the phone): 18001 then 0800 169 0145  \nBritish Sign Language (BSL) [video relay service](https://connect.interpreterslive.co.uk/vrs?ilc=DWP) if you\u2019re on a computer - find out how to [use the service on mobile or tablet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oELNMfAvDxw)\n\nMonday to Friday, 8am to 6pm   \n[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)\n\n## Benefit cap amounts \n\nThe amount you get through the benefit cap depends on whether:\n\n  * you live inside or outside [Greater London](http://directory.londoncouncils.gov.uk)\n  * you\u2019re single or in a couple\n  * your children live with you (if you\u2019re single)\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re in a couple but you do not live together, you\u2019ll get the amounts for a single person.\n\n## Benefit cap outside Greater London\n\n| Per week | Per month  \n---|---|---  \nIf you\u2019re in a couple | \u00a3423.46 | \u00a31,835  \nIf you\u2019re a single parent and your children live with you | \u00a3423.46 | \u00a31,835  \nIf you\u2019re a single adult | \u00a3283.71 | \u00a31,229.42  \n  \n## Benefit cap inside Greater London\n\n| Per week | Per month  \n---|---|---  \nIf you\u2019re in a couple | \u00a3486.98 | \u00a32,110.25  \nIf you\u2019re a single parent and your children live with you | \u00a3486.98 | \u00a32,110.25  \nIf you\u2019re a single adult | \u00a3326.29 | \u00a31,413.92\n  *[DWP]: Department for Work and Pensions",

      "body": "## What Universal Credit is \n\nUniversal Credit is a payment to help with your living costs. It\u2019s paid monthly - or [twice a month for some people in Scotland](/universal-credit/how-youre-paid).\n\nYou may be able to get it if you\u2019re on a low income, out of work or you cannot work.\n\nThis guide is also available [in Welsh (Cymraeg)](/credyd-cynhwysol) and in an [easy read format](/government/publications/easy-read-universal-credit).\n\nIf you live in Northern Ireland, go to [Universal Credit in Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/universal-credit).\n\n## Sign in\n\n[Sign in to your Universal Credit account](/sign-in-universal-credit) if you already have one.\n\n## If you already get other benefits\n\nUniversal Credit is replacing the following benefits and tax credits:\n\n  * Child Tax Credit\n  * Housing Benefit\n  * Income Support\n  * income-based Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA)\n  * income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)\n  * Working Tax Credit\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re getting any of these benefits or tax credits, you do not need to do anything unless either:\n\n  * your circumstances change\n  * you get a letter called a \u2018Migration Notice\u2019 telling you that you must claim Universal Credit\n\n\n\nIf you get a Migration Notice, you must [move to Universal Credit](/guidance/tax-credits-and-some-benefits-are-ending-move-to-universal-credit) within 3 months to keep getting financial support.\n\nYou\u2019ll stop getting these benefits and tax credits when you or your partner claim Universal Credit. If you or your partner gets Pension Credit, this will also stop if one of you claims Universal Credit.\n\nYou\u2019ll continue getting any other benefits you already receive, such as Personal Independence Payment (PIP) or Carer\u2019s Allowance.\n\nYou can read more about [how tax credits and Universal Credit affect each other](/how-tax-credits-affect-other-benefits).\n\nIf you get [certain other benefits at the same time as Universal Credit](/universal-credit/what-youll-get), the amount of Universal Credit you receive will be reduced.\n\n## Eligibility \n\nYou may be able to get Universal Credit if you\u2019re on a low income or need help with your living costs. You could be:\n\n  * out of work\n  * working (including self-employed or part time)\n  * unable to work, for example because of a health condition\n\n\n\nTo claim you must:\n\n  * live in the UK\n  * be aged 18 or over (there are some exceptions if you\u2019re 16 to 17)\n  * be under [State Pension age](/state-pension-age)\n  * have \u00a316,000 or less in [money, savings and investments](/guidance/universal-credit-money-savings-and-investments)\n\n\n\nThere are different eligibility rules if you\u2019ve received a [Migration Notice letter telling you to claim Universal Credit](/guidance/tax-credits-and-some-benefits-are-ending-move-to-universal-credit).\n\nYou can [use a benefits calculator](/benefits-calculators) to check what benefits you could get.\n\n## If you\u2019re an EU, EEA or Swiss citizen\n\nYou and your family might also need settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme to get Universal Credit. [Check if you can still apply to the EU Settlement Scheme](/settled-status-eu-citizens-families/eligibility).\n\n## If you live with your partner\n\nYou will both need to claim for Universal Credit. You must make a joint claim for your household, even if your partner is not eligible. How much you can get will depend on your partner\u2019s income and savings, as well as your own.\n\n### If one of you has reached State Pension age\n\nIf only one of you has reached [State Pension age](/calculate-state-pension), you and your partner can still claim Universal Credit as a couple. Your Universal Credit claim will stop when you both reach State Pension age.\n\nIf you\u2019re getting Pension Credit, it will stop if you or your partner make a claim for Universal Credit. You\u2019ll usually be better off staying on Pension Credit. You can check using a [benefits calculator](/benefits-calculators).\n\n## If you\u2019re studying or in training\n\nYou can make a claim for Universal Credit if you\u2019re in full-time education and any of the following apply:\n\n  * you live with your partner and they\u2019re eligible for Universal Credit\n  * you\u2019re responsible for a child, either as a single person or as a couple\n  * you\u2019ve reached [State Pension age](/state-pension-age) and live with a partner who is below State Pension age\n  * you\u2019ve received a [Migration Notice letter telling you to move to Universal Credit](/guidance/tax-credits-and-some-benefits-are-ending-move-to-universal-credit)\n\n\n\nYou can also claim Universal Credit if you\u2019re 21 or under, studying any qualification up to A level or equivalent and do not have parental support.\n\nYou may be able to claim if you are studying part-time or doing a course for which no student loan or finance is available.\n\nCheck the [guidance about claiming Universal Credit as a student](/guidance/universal-credit-and-students#studying-full-time).\n\n### Students with disabilities or health conditions\n\nYou can claim Universal Credit if you\u2019re in full-time education, and have been assessed as having limited capability for work by a Work Capability Assessment before starting your course. You must also be entitled to any of the following:\n\n  * Personal Independence Payment (PIP)\n  * Disability Living Allowance (DLA)\n  * Child Disability Payment (CDP) in Scotland\n  * Attendance Allowance\n  * Armed Forces Independence Payment\n  * Adult Disability Payment (ADP) in Scotland\n  * Pension Age Disability Payment (PADP) in Scotland\n\n\n\n## Claiming if you\u2019re 16 or 17\n\nYou can make a claim for Universal Credit if any of the following apply:\n\n  * you have a health condition or disability and have medical evidence for it, such as a fit note\n  * you\u2019re caring for someone who gets a health or disability-related benefit\n  * you\u2019re responsible for a child\n  * you live with your partner, have responsibility for a child and your partner is eligible for Universal Credit\n  * you\u2019re pregnant and expecting your baby in the next 11 weeks\n  * you\u2019ve had a baby in the last 15 weeks\n  * you do not have parental support, for example you do not live with your parents and are not under local authority care\n\n\n\n## If you have a disability or health condition\n\nIf you have [a health condition that affects your ability to work](/health-conditions-disability-universal-credit) you might get extra money for Universal Credit.\n\n## What you'll get \n\nUniversal Credit is [paid monthly](/universal-credit/how-youre-paid). How much you get depends on:\n\n  * your standard allowance\n  * any extra amounts that apply to you\n  * any money taken off your payment\n  * if you\u2019re working, [how much you earn](/universal-credit/how-your-wages-affect-your-payments)\n\n\n\nSee how much you could get by using a [benefits calculator](/benefits-calculators).\n\n## Standard allowance\n\nYou\u2019ll get one standard allowance for your household.\n\nHow much you\u2019ll get | Monthly standard allowance  \n---|---  \nIf you\u2019re single and under 25 | \u00a3311.68  \nIf you\u2019re single and 25 or over | \u00a3393.45  \nIf you live with your partner and you\u2019re both under 25 | \u00a3489.23 (for you both)  \nIf you live with your partner and either of you are 25 or over | \u00a3617.60 (for you both)  \n  \n## Extra amounts\n\nYou may get more money on top of your standard allowance if you\u2019re eligible.\n\n### If you have children\n\nYou could get an extra amount for your children if they live with you. You would get the extra amount until the 31 August after their:\n\n  * 16th birthday\n  * 19th birthday, if they\u2019re in eligible education or training \u2013 for example, they\u2019re studying for GCSEs, A levels, BTECs, Scottish Highers and SVQs or NVQs up to level 3\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll only get an extra amount for your first and second child. You will not get an extra amount for any more children unless:\n\n  * your children were born before 6 April 2017\n  * you were already claiming for 3 or more children before 6 April 2017\n  * other [exceptions apply](/guidance/universal-credit-and-families-with-more-than-2-children-information-for-claimants)\n\n\n\n### If your child has a disability\n\nYou might get an extra monthly amount if any of your children are disabled. You\u2019ll get this extra amount no matter how many children you have. \n\nYou\u2019ll get:\n\n  * \u00a3156.11 if you get the lower rate\n\n  * \u00a3487.58 if you get the higher rate\n\n\n\n\nThe amount you get depends on the [benefits your child receives and whether they have specific disabilities](/government/publications/universal-credit-and-your-family-quick-guide/universal-credit-further-information-for-families#support-for-disabled-children).\n\n### Childcare costs\n\nYou can claim back up to 85% of your childcare costs if you\u2019re working. If you live with your partner both of you need to be working, unless one of you is unable to work due to a disability or health condition.\n\nThe childcare needs to be from a registered provider. You can get help paying for childcare including nurseries, childminders, breakfast clubs, after school care and holiday clubs.\n\nThe most you can get each month is:\n\n  * \u00a31,014.63 for one child\n\n  * \u00a31,739.37 for 2 or more children\n\n\n\n\nYou need to pay your childcare costs up front and claim the money back as part of your payment. You can get support to help you pay your childcare costs up front. Talk to your work coach after you\u2019ve made your claim.\n\nRead more about [childcare costs and Universal Credit](/guidance/universal-credit-childcare-costs).\n\n### If you have a disability or health condition\n\nHow much you\u2019ll get | Extra monthly amount  \n---|---  \nIf you have limited capability for work and work-related activity | \u00a3416.19  \nIf you have limited capability for work and you started your health-related Universal Credit or Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) claim before 3 April 2017 | \u00a3156.11  \n  \nIf you live with your partner and you both have limited capability for work and work-related activity, you\u2019ll only get one extra monthly amount.\n\nIf you get the severe disability premium and you\u2019re moving to Universal Credit, you might also be entitled to a \u2018transitional protection\u2019 payment.\n\nRead more about [health conditions, disability and Universal Credit](/health-conditions-disability-universal-credit).\n\n### If you care for someone who gets a health or disability-related benefit\n\nYou could get an extra amount if you care for someone who gets one of the following benefits:\n\n  * [Adult Disability Payment \u2013 standard or enhanced award](https://www.mygov.scot/adult-disability-payment)\n  * [Armed Forces Independence Payment](/claim-for-injury-received-while-serving/armed-forces-independence-payment-afip)\n  * [Attendance Allowance](/attendance-allowance)\n  * [Child Disability Payment \u2013 middle or highest care award](https://www.mygov.scot/child-disability-payment)\n  * [Constant Attendance Allowance](/constant-attendance-allowance/what-youll-get) \\- full day rate, intermediate rate or exceptional rate with Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit\n  * [Constant Attendance Allowance](/constant-attendance-allowance/what-youll-get) \\- full day rate with a War Disablement Pension\n  * [Disability Living Allowance \u2013 middle or highest care rate](/dla-disability-living-allowance-benefit/DLA-rates)\n  * [Personal Independence Payment \u2013 either rate of the daily living part](/pip/how-much-youll-get)\n\n\n\nYou need to provide care for them for at least 35 hours a week.\n\nYou\u2019ll get an extra monthly amount of \u00a3198.31.\n\nThis is on top of any extra amount you get if you have a disabled child.\n\n### Housing costs\n\nYou could get money to help pay your [housing costs](/housing-and-universal-credit). The payment can cover rent and some service charges.\n\nIf you\u2019re a homeowner, you might be able to get a [loan to help with interest payments](/housing-and-universal-credit/property-you-own) on your mortgage.\n\n## Money taken off your payment\n\nYour payments might be reduced if any of the following apply:\n\n  * you are paying back an advance on a Universal Credit payment\n\n  * you would get above the [amount limited by the benefit cap](/benefit-cap/benefit-cap-amounts)\n\n  * you\u2019ve been overpaid benefits in the past\n\n  * you owe money for Council Tax, court fines, electricity, gas, water or Child Maintenance\n\n  * you pay your gas or electricity bill directly from your Universal Credit payment\n\n  * you have a [paid job](/universal-credit/how-your-wages-affect-your-payments)\n\n  * you have other income \u2013 for example, money from pensions or certain other benefits\n\n  * you have more than \u00a36,000 in [money, savings and investments](/guidance/universal-credit-money-savings-and-investments)\n\n\n\n\nIf you have over \u00a36,000 in money, savings and investments, your payment will be reduced by \u00a34.35 for every \u00a3250 you have between \u00a36,000 and \u00a316,000. Another \u00a34.35 is taken off for any remaining amount that is not a complete \u00a3250.\n\nFind out more about [money taken off your Universal Credit payment](/guidance/find-out-about-money-taken-off-your-universal-credit-payment).\n\n### Benefits that affect how much Universal Credit you get\n\nYou can get Universal Credit at the same time as other benefits. Your Universal Credit payment will be reduced by an amount equal to the other benefit\u2019s payment. This applies when you get Universal Credit and any of the following benefits:\n\n  * Armed Forces Pensions\n  * Carer\u2019s Allowance\n  * Carer Support Payment (Scotland)\n  * Incapacity Benefit\n  * Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit (excluding any increases where constant attendance is needed and for exceptionally severe disablement)\n  * Maternity Allowance\n  * New Style Employment and Support Allowance\n  * New Style Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance\n  * Severe Disablement Allowance\n  * State Pension\n  * Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance\n  * Widowed Parent\u2019s Allowance\n\n\n\n## Moving to Universal Credit from other benefits\n\nIf you\u2019ve applied for Universal Credit, you\u2019ll keep getting your current benefit paid for 2 more weeks. You must still be eligible for your current benefit.\n\nThis only applies if you\u2019re getting:\n\n  * income-based Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance\n\n  * income-related Employment and Support Allowance\n\n  * Income Support\n\n  * Housing Benefit\n\n\n\n\nYou will not need to pay back the extra payments and they will not affect the Universal Credit you might get.\n\nIf you\u2019ve received a Migration Notice letter telling you to claim Universal Credit, you might also get a [\u2018transitional protection\u2019 payment](/guidance/tax-credits-and-some-benefits-are-ending-move-to-universal-credit).\n\n## Other support you could get\n\nIf you receive Universal Credit you may also be able to get [other financial support](/universal-credit/other-financial-support) depending on your circumstances.\n\n## If your Universal Credit claim is reviewed\n\nYour claim might be reviewed to make sure you\u2019re getting the right payment and support. Find out more about [Universal Credit reviews](/universal-credit-reviews).\n\n## How your wages affect your payments \n\nIf you or your partner are working, how much Universal Credit you get will depend on how much you earn. There\u2019s no limit to how many hours you can work and still get Universal Credit.\n\nIf your wages go up, your Universal Credit payment will reduce. If you stop working or your wages go down, your payment will increase.\n\nThere are different rules [if you\u2019re self-employed](/self-employment-and-universal-credit).\n\nFor every \u00a31 you earn from working, your Universal Credit payment goes down by 55p. Your income will be your wages plus your new Universal Credit payment.\n\nUse a [benefits calculator](/benefits-calculators) to see how your Universal Credit changes if your wages go up.\n\nMost employers will report your wages for you. You will normally only need to report monthly earnings if you\u2019re self-employed.\n\n## If you have a disability, health condition or have children\n\nYou can earn a certain amount before your Universal Credit starts to be reduced if you or your partner are either:\n\n  * responsible for a child or young person\n  * living with a [disability or health condition](/health-conditions-disability-universal-credit) that affects your ability to work\n\n\n\nThis amount is called a \u2018work allowance\u2019. How much you can earn before your Universal Credit payment is reduced depends on whether you get housing costs.\n\nIf you get help with housing costs, your payment will start to reduce when your monthly wages reach \u00a3404.\n\nIf you do not get help with housing costs, your payment will start to reduce when your monthly wages reach \u00a3673.\n\n## How often and how much you\u2019re paid\n\nThe amount of Universal Credit you get is calculated each month. This is called your \u2018[monthly assessment period](/universal-credit/how-youre-paid).\u2019\n\nYour Universal Credit amount should stay the same if your:\n\n  * employer pays you the same amount each month\n  * employer pays you on the same date\n  * personal circumstances do not change\n\n\n\nYour Universal Credit amount will be affected if you:\n\n  * do not get paid during a monthly assessment period\n  * get paid more than once in a monthly assessment period\n  * earn a different amount in each monthly assessment period\n\n\n\nYou can check how much Universal Credit you\u2019ll be paid by signing in to your online account.\n\nRead more about [Universal Credit and earnings](/guidance/universal-credit-and-earnings).\n\n## If your Universal Credit payment stops because your wages increased\n\nAs you or your partner\u2019s wages increase, your Universal Credit payments will reduce until you\u2019re earning enough to no longer get Universal Credit. Your payments will then be stopped. You\u2019ll be told when this happens.\n\nIf your wages decrease after this, you could become eligible for Universal Credit again.\n\nIf it\u2019s been 6 months or less since your last Universal Credit payment, you\u2019ll automatically start getting payments again. If it\u2019s been more than 6 months, you\u2019ll need to reapply for Universal Credit.\n\n## How you're paid \n\nUniversal Credit is paid once a month, usually into your bank, building society or credit union account.\n\nYour payment can include [money for your rent](https://www.gov.uk/housing-and-universal-credit) or other housing costs. You\u2019ll usually need to pay this to your landlord.\n\nIf you\u2019re not able to open a bank, building society or credit union account, [call the Universal Credit helpline](/universal-credit/contact-universal-credit) to arrange a different way of getting paid.\n\nFind out how you\u2019ll be paid if [you\u2019re in Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/how-and-when-you-get-paid-universal-credit).\n\n## Your first payment\n\nIt usually takes around 5 weeks to get your first payment. If you need money while you wait for your first payment, you can [apply for an advance](/universal-credit/get-an-advance-first-payment).\n\n## Your monthly assessment periods\n\nUniversal Credit is [calculated based on your circumstances](/universal-credit/what-youll-get) each month. These are called your \u2018assessment periods\u2019. You\u2019ll usually get your Universal Credit payment 7 days after each monthly assessment period ends.\n\n[Changes in your circumstances](/universal-credit/changes-of-circumstances) can affect how much you\u2019re paid for your assessment period. You should report a change of circumstances to get the correct payment.\n\nYour first assessment period starts the day you make a claim.\n\n### Example\n\nSam makes a new Universal Credit claim on 10 September.\n\nSam\u2019s first assessment period runs for one month to 9 October, with a new assessment period beginning on 10 October.\n\nThey get paid on 17 October and then on the 17th of each month after that.\u200b\n\n## Payment dates\n\nAfter the first payment, you\u2019ll be paid on the same date of every month.\n\nIf your payment date is on a weekend or a bank holiday, you\u2019ll be paid on the working day before.\n\nYou can see your monthly statement in your online account. This tells you how much Universal Credit you\u2019re going to get.\n\n### If you live in Scotland\n\nYou can get paid once or twice a month.\n\nIf you\u2019re making a new claim, you\u2019ll get a notification about how often you want to be paid. You get this after your first payment.\n\nIf you\u2019re already getting Universal Credit and have not had a notification, you can ask your work coach if you can be paid twice a month.\n\nWhen you\u2019re paid twice a month your first payment will be for a full month. You\u2019ll get the first half of your second month\u2019s payment a month after this. The second half will be paid 15 days later. This means there will be about a month and a half between your first payment and the full amount for your second month.\n\nAfter this, you\u2019ll be paid twice a month.\n\n#### Example\n\nYou get your first payment on 14 December. This payment is for a full month.\n\nIf you\u2019re paid twice a month, you get half of your second payment on 14 January and the other half on 29 January.\n\nYou get paid on the 14th and 29th of each month after that.\n\n## If you live with a partner\n\nIf you both claim Universal Credit, you\u2019ll get one payment each month for your household.\n\nIf you live in Scotland and you\u2019ve chosen to be paid twice monthly, you\u2019ll receive 2 payments each month for your household.\n\n[Call the Universal Credit helpline](/universal-credit/contact-universal-credit) if you\u2019re worried about getting access to this money.\n\n## Ask to change how you\u2019re paid\n\nYou can ask to have your Universal Credit paid differently if you need help managing a single monthly payment. This is called an [Alternative Payment Arrangement (APA)](/government/publications/universal-credit-alternative-payment-arrangements). Having an APA could mean:\n\n  * your rent is paid directly to your landlord\n  * you receive payments twice a month instead of once a month\n  * you arrange to get a separate payment from your partner\n\n\n\nYou should contact Universal Credit after you\u2019ve made a claim to ask for an APA. They\u2019ll decide whether you should have an APA based on your circumstances.\n\nYou\u2019re more likely to get an APA if you have things like:\n\n  * unpaid rent (also known as being in \u2018rent arrears\u2019)\n  * addiction problems\n  * mental health issues\n  * learning difficulties\n  * experience of homelessness\n  * experience of domestic abuse\n\n## How to claim \n\nYou can apply for Universal Credit online.\n\nYou need to create an account to make a claim. You must complete your claim within 28 days of creating your account or you will have to start again. Your claim starts on the date you submit it in your account.\n\nIf you live with your partner, you will both need to create accounts. You\u2019ll link them together when you claim. You cannot claim by yourself.\n\nIf you cannot claim online, you can claim by phone through the Universal Credit helpline.\n\n## Check if you\u2019re better off on Universal Credit before you apply\n\nIf you already get benefits or tax credits, you should work out if you\u2019ll be better off before you or your partner claim Universal Credit.\n\nIf you apply for Universal Credit those benefits might end and you will not be able to apply for them again, even if your application is not approved.\n\nTo check if you\u2019re better off, you can:\n\n  * use a [benefits calculator](/benefits-calculators)\n\n  * contact [the Citizens Advice Help to Claim service](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/about-us/contact-us/contact-us/help-to-claim/)\n\n  * ask a [local benefits adviser](https://advicelocal.uk/find-an-adviser)\n\n\n\n\n## What you need to apply\n\nTo apply online you\u2019ll need:\n\n  * your bank, building society or credit union account details\n  * an email address\n  * access to a phone\n\n\n\nIf you do not have these, you can call the Universal Credit helpline or go to a jobcentre. You can also get support from the Citizens Advice Help to Claim service.\n\nYou\u2019ll also have to prove your identity. You\u2019ll need some identity documents for this, for example your:\n\n  * driving licence\n  * passport\n  * debit or credit card\n  * payslip or P60\n\n\n\nTo complete your claim you will need to provide information about:\n\n  * [your housing](/housing-and-universal-credit), for example how much rent you pay\n  * your earnings, for example payslips\n  * your [National Insurance number](/national-insurance/your-national-insurance-number), if you have one\n  * other benefits you get\n  * any disability or health condition that affects your work\n  * how much you pay for childcare if you want help with childcare costs\n  * your [savings and any investments](/guidance/universal-credit-money-savings-and-investments), like shares or a property that you rent out\n\n\n\nYou might need an appointment with the Universal Credit team if:\n\n  * they need more information\n  * you cannot verify your identity online\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll be told if this appointment will be in a jobcentre or on the phone.\n\nYou will have to go to a meeting to agree the activities in [your claimant commitment](/universal-credit/your-claimant-commitment) before you can get your first payment.\n\n## Apply for Universal Credit online\n\n[ Apply now ](https://www.universal-credit.service.gov.uk/postcode-checker)\n\n### Help with your claim\n\nThere are 2 ways to get help with your Universal Credit claim.

You start paying it back out of your first payment.\n\n### Example\n\nYour first estimated payment is \u00a3344 and you get \u00a3344 as an advance.\n\nYou pay back your advance over 24 months, which is \u00a314.33 per month. You\u2019ll get \u00a3329.67 on your first payment date - this is your first payment minus the bit you\u2019re repaying (\u00a3344 minus \u00a314.33).\n\nRead more about [getting a Universal Credit advance](/guidance/universal-credit-advances).\n\n## Your claimant commitment \n\nTo get Universal Credit payments, you\u2019ll need to accept an agreement called a \u2018claimant commitment\u2019.\n\nThis is a record of what you agree to do to:\n\n  * prepare for and look for work\n  * increase your earnings, if you are already working.\n\n\n\nIf you live with your partner, you both have to claim Universal Credit. You\u2019ll each have your own claimant commitment.\n\nYou must do everything you agree to in your commitment or your payment could be reduced or stopped. This is called a sanction.\n\nIf a medical professional has said you might have 12 months or less to live, you will not need a claimant commitment and you will not get a sanction.\n\n## Agreeing your commitments\n\nYou will have a meeting to discuss your claimant commitment, usually at the jobcentre. In this meeting you\u2019ll discuss your circumstances and talk about anything that could make it hard for you to do what\u2019s in your commitment. For example, if you have a mental health condition, or if you care for someone.\n\nYou must accept your claimant commitment in your online account or your Universal Credit claim will be stopped.\n\nYour claimant commitment is reviewed regularly and will change if your circumstances change. For example, if you get ill, your partner starts a job or you have a child.\n\n## If you need to look for work\n\nYou might need to look for a job. If you have a job, you might need to look for a better paid job or try to work more hours.\n\nWhat you need to do depends on if you:\n\n  * have a health condition or are disabled\n  * care for someone\n  * have a child under 13\n  * earn above a certain amount (the [\u2018administrative earnings threshold\u2019](/guidance/universal-credit-and-earnings#earnings-and-your-responsibilities))\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re not able to work now but you will be able to in the future, you might need to prepare for work. This could include things like writing a CV or attending a training course.\n\n### Your work coach\n\nIf you need to look for work, you will get help from a \u2018work coach\u2019. Your work coach can help with things like applying for jobs, accessing training or looking for work in your area.\n\n## Attending appointments\n\nYou may need to attend regular appointments. These are usually in the jobcentre, but could also be by phone.\n\nIf you miss an appointment, you\u2019ll need to provide a good reason for not attending. If your reason is not accepted, you could get a sanction and your Universal Credit payment will be reduced.\n\n## Managing your claim online\n\nYou will have to manage your claim in your online account. You might have to reply to messages, record your childcare costs, or tell us what you\u2019ve done to look for work.\n\nYou\u2019ll get a text or email when you need to do something in your online account.\n\nYou will also have to [report changes in your circumstances](/universal-credit/changes-of-circumstances).\n\n## Get help and support\n\nYou should [contact the Universal Credit helpline](/universal-credit/contact-universal-credit) for support straight away if you:\n\n  * are unable to manage your claim online and need to claim by phone\n  * cannot do the things you\u2019ve agreed to in your claimant commitment\n  * are unable to respond to a message or do something you\u2019re asked to in your online account\n  * will miss an appointment\n\n\n\nYou may be able to get a short pause or change to your claimant commitment in an emergency. For example, if you have a death in the family or are at risk of homelessness.\n\n## Help if your payment is stopped or reduced\n\nIf you do not do what is in your claimant commitment, you could get a sanction.\n\nIf you cannot pay for your rent, heating, food or hygiene needs because you got a sanction, you can [ask Universal Credit for a hardship payment](/guidance/universal-credit-recoverable-hardship-payments-rhps).\n\n## Report a change of circumstances \n\nYou need to report changes to your circumstances so you keep getting the right amount each month.\n\nYou need to report changes as soon as they happen. Any delay may mean you receive too much money and will have to make a repayment.\n\nChanges in your circumstances can affect how much you\u2019re paid for your whole assessment period - not just from the date you report them.\n\nChanges can include:\n\n  * finding or finishing a job\n  * having a child\n  * moving in with your partner\n  * starting to care for a child or disabled person\n  * your child stopping or restarting education or training, if they\u2019re aged 16 to 19\n  * changing your mobile number or email address\n  * moving to a new address\n  * going outside Great Britain for any length of time, if you live there\n  * going outside Northern Ireland for any length of time, if you live there\n  * changing your bank details\n  * your rent going up or down\n  * changes to your health condition\n  * becoming too ill to work or meet your work coach\n  * changes to your earnings (only if you\u2019re self-employed)\n  * changes to your [savings, investments and how much money you have](/guidance/universal-credit-money-savings-and-investments)\n  * changes to your immigration status, if you\u2019re not a British citizen\n\n\n\nYou could be taken to court or have to pay a penalty if you give wrong information or do not report a change in your circumstances.\n\n## How to report\n\nYou can report a change of circumstances by [signing in to your Universal Credit account](/sign-in-universal-credit).\n\n## If you get a job or increase the hours you work\n\nUse a [benefits calculator](/benefits-calculators) or speak with your work coach to find out how getting a job or an increase in your earnings might affect your Universal Credit claim.\n\nMost employers will report your earnings for you. You will normally only need to report monthly earnings if you are self-employed.\n\n## If you\u2019ve been paid too much\n\nYou may have to repay the money if you:\n\n  * did not report a change straight away\n  * gave wrong information\n  * were overpaid by mistake\n\n\n\nFind out how to [repay the money you owe from benefit overpayment](/benefit-overpayments).\n\n## If you\u2019re nearing the end of life\n\nYou may get extra money if you\u2019re nearing the end of life because of an illness. You may also be able to [get other benefits](/benefits-end-of-life).\n\n### If you\u2019ve been told you might have more than 12 months to live\n\nYou\u2019ll need to report this in the same way as any other change of circumstance.\n\n### If you\u2019ve been told you might have 12 months or less to live\n\nReport the change online through your [Universal Credit account](/sign-in-universal-credit). You\u2019ll be contacted about what to do next.\n\nYou can also get someone else to report the change for you. They should ask a doctor or medical professional to fill in form SR1.\n\nThe doctor will have the form already. Either the doctor or your representative can send it to:\n\nFreepost   \nDepartment for Work and Pensions   \nUniversal Credit Full Service\n\nIf you\u2019ve already sent form SR1 for another benefit, for example Employment and Support Allowance, you do not need to send it again.\n\nYou will not need to have a Work Capability Assessment.\n\n## Financial help and support \n\nIf you need financial support, you can get help and advice from the government, local councils and other organisations.\n\nIf you get Universal Credit, you could be eligible for other benefits or financial support. You should [check what you can get](/check-benefits-financial-support).\n\nYou might be able to get [different support in Scotland](https://www.gov.scot/policies/social-security/universal-credit/).\n\n## If you need money urgently\n\nIf you do not have enough to live on while you wait for your first Universal Credit payment, you can ask for an [advance payment](/universal-credit/get-an-advance-first-payment) after you\u2019ve made a claim.\n\nIf you [got a sanction](/universal-credit/your-claimant-commitment) and now cannot pay for rent, heating, or food, you can also ask for a hardship payment. You should [check if you are eligible](/guidance/universal-credit-recoverable-hardship-payments-rhps).\n\nYou will need to pay this back. Your Universal Credit payments will be lower until it\u2019s repaid.\n\n## How to get an advance in an emergency\n\nYou might be able to get a Budgeting Advance to help with:\n\n  * emergency household costs such as replacing a broken cooker\n  * getting a job or staying in work\n  * funeral costs\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll repay it through your regular Universal Credit payments - these will be lower until you pay it back.

It\u2019s being replaced by Universal Credit.\n\nYou can only make a new claim for Housing Benefit if either of the following apply:\n\n  * you have reached [State Pension age](/state-pension-age)\n  * you\u2019re in supported, sheltered or temporary housing\n\n\n\nThis guide is also available [in Welsh (Cymraeg)](/budd-dal-tai).\n\n## You\u2019ve reached State Pension age\n\nIf you\u2019re single you can make a new claim for Housing Benefit.\n\n### If you\u2019re over State Pension age and live with your partner\n\nYou can make a new claim for Housing Benefit if any of the following apply:\n\n  * you and your partner have both reached State Pension age\n  * one of you has reached State Pension age and started claiming Pension Credit (for you as a couple) before 15 May 2019\n  * you\u2019re in supported, sheltered or temporary housing\n\n\n\n### If you\u2019re over State Pension age and have an existing claim\n\nYour existing claim will not be affected if, before 15 May 2019, you:\n\n  * were getting Housing Benefit\n  * had reached State Pension age\n\n\n\nIt does not matter if your partner is under State Pension age.\n\nIf your circumstances change and your Housing Benefit is stopped, you cannot start getting it again unless you and your partner are eligible to make a new claim.\n\nYou can [apply for Universal Credit](/universal-credit) if you\u2019re not eligible.\n\n## If you\u2019re in supported, sheltered or temporary housing\n\nYou can make a new claim if:\n\n  * you\u2019re living in temporary accommodation, such as a B&B arranged by your council\n  * you\u2019re living in a refuge for survivors of domestic abuse\n  * you\u2019re living in sheltered or supported housing (such as a hostel) which provides you with \u2018care, support or supervision\u2019\n\n\n\nIf you do not get \u2018care, support or supervision\u2019 through your supported or sheltered housing, you can apply for [Universal Credit to help with housing costs](/housing-and-universal-credit).\n\nIf you\u2019re in supported, sheltered or temporary housing, you can apply for Universal Credit to help with other living costs.\n\n## When you may not be able to claim\n\nUsually, you will not get Housing Benefit if:\n\n  * your savings are over \u00a316,000 - unless you get Guarantee Credit of Pension Credit\n  * you\u2019re paying a mortgage on your own home - you may be able to get [Support for Mortgage Interest (SMI)](/support-for-mortgage-interest)\n  * you live in the home of a close relative\n  * you\u2019re already claiming [Universal Credit](/housing-and-universal-credit) (unless you\u2019re in temporary or supported housing)\n  * you live with your partner and they are already claiming Housing Benefit\n  * you\u2019re a full-time student\n  * you\u2019re residing in the UK as a [European Economic Area (EEA)](/eu-eea) jobseeker\n  * you\u2019re an asylum seeker or sponsored to be in the UK\n  * you\u2019re subject to immigration control and your granted leave states that you cannot claim public funds\n  * you\u2019re a Crown Tenant\n  * you\u2019ve reached State Pension age but your live-in partner has not - unless you had an existing claim as a couple before 15 May 2019\n\n\n\nYou may be able to get [other help with housing costs](/housing-benefit/other-help-with-housing-costs).\n\nIf not, you\u2019ll need to [claim Universal Credit](/housing-and-universal-credit) instead.\n\nUse a [benefits calculator](/benefits-calculators) to check if you can get Housing Benefit before you apply.\n\n## What you'll get \n\nYou may get help with all or part of your rent. There\u2019s no set amount of Housing Benefit and what you get will depend on whether you rent privately or from a council.\n\nUse a [benefits calculator](/benefits-calculators) to work out what you could get or check what [extra help](/housing-benefit/other-help-with-housing-costs) is available.\n\n## Council and social housing rent\n\nHow much you get depends on:\n\n  * your \u2018eligible\u2019 rent\n  * if you have a spare room\n  * your household income - including benefits, pensions and savings (over \u00a36,000)\n  * your circumstances, for example the age of people in the house or if someone has a disability\n\n\n\n### Eligible rent\n\nYour eligible rent is the amount used to calculate your Housing Benefit claim. It\u2019s your actual rent plus any service charges you have to pay (such as for lift maintenance or a communal laundry) but not things like heating or water costs for your home.\n\n### Spare bedrooms\n\nYour Housing Benefit could be reduced if you live in council or social housing and have a spare bedroom.

      "body": "## How it works \n\nYou can apply for New Style Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA) to help you when you\u2019re looking for work.\n\nThis guide is also available [in Welsh (Cymraeg)](/lwfans-ceisio-gwaith).\n\nYou cannot apply for income-based JSA any more. [If you\u2019re currently getting income-based JSA](/jobseekers-allowance/if-youre-getting-income-based-jsa), you\u2019ll keep getting payments while you\u2019re eligible until your claim ends.\n\nYou could get Universal Credit at the same time or instead of New Style JSA. [Check if you\u2019re eligible for Universal Credit](/universal-credit/eligibility).\n\n## What you need to do\n\n  1. [Check you\u2019re eligible](/jobseekers-allowance/eligibility).\n\n  2. [Make a claim for New Style Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA)](/jobseekers-allowance/apply-new-style-jsa) and go to an interview at your local Jobcentre Plus office.\n\n  3. Keep to your agreement to look for work. This agreement is called a \u2018Claimant Commitment\u2019 and you will create it at your interview.\n\n\n\n\n[Your JSA payments will be reduced or stopped](/jobseekers-allowance/your-jsa-claim) if you do not keep to your agreement to look for work and cannot give a good reason.\n\n## What you\u2019ll get\n\nThere\u2019s a maximum amount you can get - but how much you\u2019re entitled to depends on your age.\n\nUse a [benefits calculator](/benefits-calculators) to check how much JSA you can get, and how your other benefits will be affected.\n\nAge |  JSA weekly amount  \n---|---  \nUp to 24 | up to \u00a371.70  \n25 or over | up to \u00a390.50  \n  \n## How you\u2019re paid\n\nAll benefits, pensions and allowances are usually paid into your [bank, building society or credit union account](/how-to-have-your-benefits-paid).\n\n### Your first payment\n\nYou may have to wait up to 7 days after applying for your JSA to start, and up to 2 weeks after that to get your first payment.\n\nYour first payment may not be for the full amount.\n\n### After your first payment\n\nPayments will usually be made every 2 weeks and they will be the full amount.\n\n## If you\u2019re moving to Universal Credit from income-based JSA\n\nIf your income-based JSA claim is ending because you\u2019re making a new claim for Universal Credit, you\u2019ll automatically continue to get the amount of JSA you currently receive, as long as you\u2019re still eligible. You\u2019ll normally get this for 2 weeks, starting from the date of your new claim.\n\nThe Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will write to you telling you how this works.\n\nYou do not need to pay this money back, and it will not affect the amount of Universal Credit you get.\n\n## Eligibility \n\nTo be eligible for New Style Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA) you\u2019ll need to have both:\n\n  * worked as an employee\n  * paid Class 1 National Insurance contributions, usually in the last 2 to 3 years ([National Insurance credits](/national-insurance-credits) can also count)\n\n\n\nYou will not be eligible if you were self-employed and only paid Class 2 National Insurance contributions, unless you were working as a share fisherman or a volunteer development worker.\n\nYou\u2019ll also need to:\n\n  * be 18 or over (there are some exceptions if you\u2019re 16 or 17 - [contact Jobcentre Plus](/contact-jobcentre-plus) for advice)\n  * be under the [State Pension age](/check-state-pension)\n  * not be in full-time education\n  * be available for work\n  * not be working at the moment, or be working less than 16 hours per week on average\n  * not have an illness or disability which stops you from working\n  * live in the UK\n\n\n\nWhile you receive JSA, you\u2019ll need to take reasonable steps to look for work as agreed with your work coach.\n\nYour savings and your partner\u2019s income and savings will not affect your claim.\n\nYou can get New Style Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA) for up to 182 days (about 6 months). After this you can talk to your work coach about your options.\n\n## Claiming Universal Credit and New Style JSA\n\nYou might be able to get [Universal Credit](/universal-credit) at the same time or instead of New Style JSA.\n\nIf you get both benefits, your New Style JSA payments:\n\n  * count as income when claiming Universal Credit\n  * will reduce the amount of Universal Credit you receive\n\n\n\nYour New Style JSA will usually be paid more regularly than Universal Credit. You\u2019ll also get different [National Insurance credits](/national-insurance-credits) which count towards your State Pension and help you qualify for other benefits.\n\n[Check if you\u2019re eligible for Universal Credit](/universal-credit/eligibility).\n\n## Apply for New Style Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) \n\nBefore you apply for New Style Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA), [check if you\u2019re eligible](/jobseekers-allowance/eligibility).\n\nTo apply, you\u2019ll need your:\n\n  * [National Insurance number](/lost-national-insurance-number)\n  * bank or building society account details (or those of a family member or trusted friend)\n  * employment details for the past 6 months, including employer contact details and dates you worked with them\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll also need to provide a statement letter if you receive any money from:\n\n  * your [private pension](/pension-types)\n  * your [workplace pension](/workplace-pensions)\n  * an [annuity you\u2019ve bought](/personal-pensions-your-rights/how-you-can-take-pension)\n\n\n\nTo reclaim you need to apply again, even if your details have not changed.\n\nYou can backdate your claim by up to 3 months in certain circumstances.\n\n## Apply online\n\nYou cannot apply online if you\u2019re under 18 or if you\u2019re applying as an appointee on someone else\u2019s behalf.\n\n[Apply for New Style JSA](https://www.dwpe-services.direct.gov.uk/en/jobseekersallowanceclaim)\n\n## If you cannot apply online or need alternative formats\n\nYou can apply another way if any of the following apply:\n\n  * you\u2019re aged 16 to 17\n  * you\u2019re applying as an appointee on someone else\u2019s behalf\n  * you need help applying\n  * you need communications to be sent to you in an alternative format, such as braille, large print or audio CD\n\n\n\nYou need to either:\n\n  * [contact Jobcentre Plus](/contact-jobcentre-plus/new-benefit-claims) if you live in England, Scotland or Wales\n  * [contact the Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance Processing Centre](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/contacts/jobseekers-allowance-processing-centre) if you live in Northern Ireland\n\n\n\n## After you make your claim\n\nIf you gave your mobile number or email address in your online application, you\u2019ll get a text or email to confirm it\u2019s been submitted.\n\nThe Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will then contact you within 14 days of applying. You\u2019ll either:\n\n  * be [invited to an interview at your local Jobcentre Plus office](/jobseekers-allowance/your-jsa-interview)\n  * receive a letter to explain why you\u2019re not eligible for JSA\n\n\n\nYou do not need to contact DWP unless it has been more than 14 days since you applied and you have not heard anything.\n\n## If you disagree with a decision\n\nYou can [challenge a decision](/mandatory-reconsideration) about your claim. This is called asking for mandatory reconsideration.\n\n## Make a complaint\n\nYou can [complain about Jobcentre Plus](/complain-jobcentre-plus) if you\u2019re unhappy with the service you\u2019ve received.\n\n## Your JSA interview \n\nIf you\u2019re invited to an interview, you must attend. It will be at your local Jobcentre Plus office.\n\nYou\u2019ll be asked some questions to confirm your identity and then you\u2019ll make an agreement about what steps you\u2019ll take to look for work.\n\n## Documents you need to bring to your interview\n\nYou\u2019ll need to bring all of the following:\n\n  * one photographic proof of identity\n  * one proof of address\n  * one further proof of identity\n\n\n\nIf you have a [P45 from your employer](/paye-forms-p45-p60-p11d), bring this to your interview. When you present it, tell your work coach if you\u2019ve already received or claimed a tax refund from HMRC for the current tax year.\n\nYou can also use your P45 as your further proof of identity.\n\n### Photographic proof of identity\n\nExamples include your:\n\n  * current passport\n  * driving licence\n  * biometric residence permit (BRP) or eVisa\n  * certificate of naturalisation as a British citizen\n  * permanent residence permit\n\n\n\n### Proof of address\n\nExamples include a:\n\n  * payslip or pension statement dated within the last 6 months\n  * utility bill dated within the last 6 months\n  * Council Tax bill dated within the last 6 months\n  * student loan documentation\n\n\n\n### Further proof of identity\n\nExamples include your:\n\n  * P60\n  * savings account book\n  * personal cheque book\n  * current debit, credit or store card with a statement confirming the card details\n\n\n\nUtility bills can be used for proof of address and as further proof of identity if they are from different suppliers.\n\n[Read the complete list of documents you can bring to your interview](/jobcentre-plus-interview).\n\n## Support at your interview\n\nYou can take someone with you to your JSA interview.\n\n[Contact your Jobcentre Plus](https://find-your-nearest-jobcentre.dwp.gov.uk/) before the interview if you need:\n\n  * support because of a disability or health condition (for example, if you\u2019re deaf and need a sign language interpreter)\n  * a foreign language interpreter and do not have someone who can help with interpretation\n\n\n\n## Sign an agreement to look for work (\u2018Claimant Commitment\u2019)\n\nAt your JSA interview, you must sign an agreement about what steps you\u2019ll take to look for a job. This is called a \u2018Claimant Commitment\u2019.\n\nYou and your work coach will agree what goes in your Claimant Commitment. This could include:\n\n  * what you need to do to look for work - for example registering with recruitment agencies, writing a CV\n  * how many hours you need to spend looking for work each week\n\n\n\nWhat you agree to do will depend on things like:\n\n  * your health\n  * your responsibilities at home\n  * how much help you need to get work or increase your income\n\n\n\n[Your JSA might be reduced or stopped](/jobseekers-allowance/your-jsa-claim) if you do not do what you\u2019ve agreed to in your Claimant Commitment and you cannot give a good reason\n\n## After your JSA interview\n\nThe Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will write to you to either:\n\n  * let you know you are eligible for JSA and how much you\u2019ll get\n  * explain why you\u2019re not eligible for JSA\n\n\n\nYou will not need to do what you\u2019ve agreed in your Claimant Commitment if you\u2019re not eligible for JSA.\n\n## Your JSA claim \n\nWhen you apply to claim JSA, your work coach will make an agreement with you to look for work. This agreement is called a \u2018Claimant Commitment\u2019.\n\nYour Claimant Commitment could include:\n\n  * what you need to do to look for work - for example registering with recruitment agencies or writing a CV\n  * how many hours you need to spend looking for work each week\n\n\n\nYou should continue to do all the things you have agreed to do if you can do them safely.\n\nYou can search and apply for work using the [\u2018Find a job\u2019 service](/find-a-job).\n\nYou must tell Jobcentre Plus [if your circumstances change](/jobseekers-allowance/report-a-change-of-circumstances), for example you start working or your income changes.\n\n## Attending regular appointments\n\nYour work coach will arrange appointments with you every 1 to 2 weeks.\n\nAt these appointments, you must show your work coach what you\u2019ve been doing to look for work, for example proof of job applications and interviews.\n\nIf you\u2019re a victim of domestic abuse you might be able to get a break of up to 13 weeks from job seeking - speak to your work coach if you need this support.\n\n## When payment can be reduced or stopped\n\nYour JSA payments can be reduced or stopped for a period if you do not do something your work coach asks you to do. This is called being \u2018sanctioned\u2019. For example, if you:\n\n  * do not take part in an appointment with your work coach\n  * do not accept or keep to your agreement to look for work\n  * turn down a job or training course\n  * do not apply for any jobs you\u2019re told about\n  * do not take part in any interviews you\u2019re invited to\n  * do not go to any training booked for you or take part in employment schemes\n\n\n\nYou may also be sanctioned if you:\n\n  * are not available to start work straight away\n  * choose to take a pay cut at your current job without a good reason\n  * have your pay cut at your current job because of something you did, such as your behaviour\n  * leave your last job or training without good reason or because of your behaviour\n\n\n\n[Contact Jobcentre Plus](/contact-jobcentre-plus) as soon as possible if any of these apply to you. You may be able to keep your payment if you have good reason.\n\nYou\u2019ll be told how long your payment will be reduced or stopped for. It could be for up to 26 weeks (about 6 months).\n\nIf you want to know how long your JSA payment could be reduced or stopped for, [read part 3 or part 4 of the guidance on JSA sanctions](/government/publications/jobseekers-allowance-sanctions-leaflet/jobseekers-allowance-sanctions-how-to-keep-your-benefit-payment).\n\n### If your JSA payment is reduced or stopped\n\nIf your payment is reduced or stopped, you should keep looking for work. Your benefit payment could be affected for longer if you do not.\n\nIf you disagree with the decision to stop payment, you can [ask for the decision to be looked at again](/mandatory-reconsideration) \\- this is called \u2018mandatory reconsideration\u2019.\n\nIf you disagree with the outcome of the mandatory reconsideration, you can [appeal to the Social Security and Child Support Tribunal](/social-security-child-support-tribunal).\n\nYou should continue with any JSA claim until the dispute is settled.\n\n### If you claim Housing Benefit or Council Tax Reduction\n\nYou should [contact your local council](/find-your-local-council) immediately. They\u2019ll tell you what to do to continue getting support.\n\n## If your claim is ended\n\nIf you get income-based JSA, your claim may be ended if you\u2019re not available for or actively seeking work.\n\nYou cannot apply for income-based JSA again. Instead, check if you\u2019re [eligible for Universal Credit](/universal-credit/eligibility) and [eligible for New Style Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA)](/jobseekers-allowance/eligibility). You could get both at the same time.\n\n## Hardship payments\n\nIf you were claiming income-based JSA, you may be able to get a hardship payment if your JSA payments have been stopped. You do not have to pay it back.\n\nA hardship payment is a reduced amount (usually 60%) of your JSA.\n\nIf you were claiming New Style Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA), you cannot get a hardship payment.\n\n### Eligibility\n\nYou can get a hardship payment if you cannot pay for rent, heating, food or other basic needs for you or your child.\n\nYou must be 18 or over.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to show that you\u2019ve tried to find the money from somewhere else, such as borrowing from a friend or working extra hours.\n\n### How to claim\n\nSpeak to your Jobcentre Plus adviser or work coach to find out how to claim a hardship payment.\n\nJobcentre Plus  \nTelephone: 0800 169 0310  \nTextphone: 0800 169 0314  \nWelsh language: 0800 328 1744  \nMonday to Friday, 8am to 6pm  \n[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)\n\n## If you\u2019re getting income-based JSA \n\nAs long as you\u2019re still eligible, you\u2019ll keep getting income-based Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA) until [your circumstances change](/jobseekers-allowance/report-a-change-of-circumstances).\n\nJobcentre Plus will talk to you about your options. If you\u2019re eligible you might be able to claim [Universal Credit](/universal-credit).\n\nYou need to take reasonable steps to look for work while getting JSA.\n\nYou must tell Jobcentre Plus if [your circumstances change](/jobseekers-allowance/report-a-change-of-circumstances), for example you start working or your income changes.\n\n## Working hours and income\n\nIf you start working more than 16 hours a week, you might stop being eligible for JSA.\n\nYou might stop being eligible for income-based JSA if:\n\n  * your partner starts working 24 hours or more a week, or increases their hours to 16 hours or more a week\n  * your savings increase to \u00a316,000 or more (including your partner\u2019s savings)\n\n\n\nYou cannot apply for income-based JSA any more. Instead, check if you\u2019re [eligible for Universal Credit](/universal-credit/eligibility) and [New Style JSA](/jobseekers-allowance/apply-new-style-jsa/eligibility). You could get both at the same time.\n\n## Report a change of circumstances \n\nYou must tell Jobcentre Plus if your circumstances change, for example you start working or your income changes. This might affect how much Jobseekers\u2019 Allowance (JSA) you get. \n\nIf you get more than one benefit, you\u2019ll need to report your change to each benefit office.\n\nThis page does not cover every change you must report. Call Jobcentre Plus if you\u2019re not sure whether you need to report a change.\n\nYour claim might be reduced or stopped if you do not report a change straight away.\n\n## New Style JSA\n\nIf you get New Style JSA, you must report if you: \n\n  * change your name, address, bank details or telephone number\n\n  * become ill or go into hospital\n\n  * start or stop caring for someone\n\n  * start or stop education, training or an apprenticeship\n\n  * start a job, including self-employment\n\n  * do any paid, unpaid or voluntary work, even if it is only for a few hours\n\n  * start getting, stop getting, or get a different amount of other benefits or pensions\n\n  * leave Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) for any period of time\n\n  * go on holiday, including holidays in Great Britain\n\n\n\n\n## Income-based JSA\n\nIf you get income-based Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance, you must report the following changes.\n\n### Changes to personal details\n\nYou need to report if:\n\n  * you or your partner change name, address, bank details or telephone number \n\n  * anybody starts or stops living with you \n\n  * you or someone included on your claim changes immigration status\n\n  * you go on holiday, including holidays in Great Britain\n\n  * you or anyone who lives with you leaves Great Britain (England, Scotland or Wales) for any period of time\n\n  * your partner or someone you live with dies\n\n\n\n\nYou also need to report if you, your partner, or anyone who lives with you:\n\n  * gets married or forms a civil partnership\n\n  * gets divorced or ends a civil partnership \n\n  * has a baby or gets pregnant\n\n  * goes into prison or legal custody\n\n\n\n\n### Changes to work and education\n\nYou need to report if you, your partner, or anyone who lives with you:\n\n  * starts or stops education, training or an apprenticeship\n\n  * finds or finishes a job, or starts working different hours\n\n  * is involved in a trade dispute, or unable to work because of a trade dispute (for example, if there\u2019s a strike)\n\n\n\n\nVolunteering will not normally affect your JSA but you should report it before you start.\n\n### Changes to income and benefits\n\nYou need to report if your household income goes up or down. Tell us if you or anyone who lives with you:\n\n  * has a change to earnings\n\n  * gets paid back-pay (sometimes called \u2018arrears\u2019) for earnings from work\n\n  * gets a different amount of benefit or pensions\n\n  * has a change to the amount of any other money coming in (for example student loans or grants, sick pay or money from a charity)\n\n\n\n\n### Changes to your savings or assets\n\nYou need to report if the total savings and assets in your household is more than \u00a36,000.\n\nYou also need to report if you or anyone who lives with you:\n\n  * has a change to the amount of savings or investments they own \n\n  * becomes the owner of any land, buildings or premises or sells any land, buildings or premises\n\n  * gets a one-off payment such as inheritance or lump sum payment\n\n\n\n\n### Changes to a medical condition or disability\n\nYou need to report if:\n\n  * you or someone included on your claim has any changes to a medical condition or disability\n\n  * you or someone included on your claim goes into hospital, a care home or sheltered accommodation\n\n  * you or someone included on your claim starts or stops caring for someone\n\n  * anybody starts or stops getting Carer\u2019s Allowance, Carer Support Payment or an extra amount of Universal Credit for caring for you\n\n\n\n\nYou may be prosecuted or have to pay a \u00a350 penalty if you give wrong or incomplete information, or do not report changes straight away.\n\n## How to report\n\nYou can report a change of circumstances by:\n\n  * calling the JSA helpline\n  * writing to the Jobcentre Plus office that pays your JSA \\- the address is on the letters you get about your JSA\n\n\n\nIf your partner or someone you live with has died, you can tell Jobcentre Plus and other government organisations in one go using the [Tell Us Once service](/after-a-death/organisations-you-need-to-contact-and-tell-us-once).\n\nJSA and New Style Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA) helpline  \nTelephone: 0800 169 0310  \nTextphone: 0800 169 0314  \n[Relay UK](https://www.relayuk.bt.com) (if you cannot hear or speak on the phone): 18001 then 0800 169 0310  \nBritish Sign Language (BSL) [video relay service](https://connect.interpreterslive.co.uk/vrs?ilc=DWP) if you\u2019re on a computer - find out how to [use the service on mobile or tablet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oELNMfAvDxw)  \nWelsh language: 0800 328 1744\n\nMonday to Friday, 8am to 5pm  \n[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)\n\nIf you\u2019re claiming [Universal Credit](/universal-credit/changes-of-circumstances) as well as New Style Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA), you must report changes to both services.\n\n## If you\u2019ve been paid too much\n\nIf you do not report a change straight away or give wrong or incomplete information, you might be paid too much.

Apply for a [Budgeting Advance](/universal-credit/other-financial-support) instead.\n\nYou also cannot get a Budgeting Loan if:\n\n  * you get New Style Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance or New Style Employment and Support Allowance\n  * you\u2019re involved in industrial action (for example a strike, walkout or lockout)\n  * you owe more than \u00a31,500 in total for Crisis Loans and Budgeting Loans\n\n## What you could get \n\nThe lowest amount you can borrow is \u00a3100.

      "body": "## Who can appeal \n\nAppeal to the Special Educational Needs and Disability (SEND) Tribunal if you disagree with a decision your local authority has made about a child or young person\u2019s education, health and care (EHC) needs or plan.\n\nYou can appeal if you do not agree with the EHC plan your local authority has made, or if they:\n\n  * refuse to carry out an EHC assessment or reassessment\n  * refuse to create an EHC plan after carrying out an assessment or reassessment\n  * refuse to change the sections of an existing EHC plan which are about education (sections B, F and I)\n  * decide you or your child does not need an EHC plan any more\n\n\n\nThe process is different if you\u2019re [in Wales](https://specialeducationalneedstribunal.gov.wales/), [in Scotland](https://enquire.org.uk/parents/getting-support/co-ordinated-support-plans/) or [in Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/special-educational-needs-statements).\n\nIn most cases, you must [talk to a mediation adviser](/appeal-ehc-plan-decision/before-you-appeal) before you appeal.\n\nYou can appeal:\n\n  * [on behalf of a child or young person](/appeal-ehc-plan-decision/appeal-as-a-parent)\n  * [as a young person](/appeal-ehc-plan-decision/appeal-as-a-young-person)\n\n\n\n## Help you can get\n\nCheck if you can [get legal aid](/check-legal-aid).\n\nYou can also get free help and advice from:\n\n  * the [Independent Parental Special Education Advice (IPSEA)](https://www.ipsea.org.uk/contact-ipsea)\n  * your local Parent Partnership Service through the [Information, Advice and Support Services (IASS) Network](https://councilfordisabledchildren.org.uk/about-us-0/networks/information-advice-and-support-services-network)\n\n## Before you appeal \n\n## What you need to appeal\n\nYour decision letter will tell you what you need to appeal. You can also speak to other organisations that are listed in your letter or with your special educational needs coordinator (SENCO).\n\n## Mediation\n\nIn most cases, you must consider mediation before you appeal to the tribunal. Mediation is when an impartial professional (the mediator) helps both sides work out an agreement. It\u2019s confidential and usually quicker than going to the tribunal.\n\nYou do not have to consider mediation if your appeal is only about which school or other institution you or your child should attend (Section I of the EHC plan).\n\n### How to arrange mediation\n\nYour local authority will have sent you a letter giving their decision about the EHC plan. The letter will tell you how to contact a mediation service.\n\nIf you do not have the letter, [contact your local authority](/find-your-local-council) to get details of your local special educational needs mediation service.\n\nA mediation adviser will explain how mediation works. If you want to go ahead, they\u2019ll bring you and your local authority together to discuss the problem.\n\nAt the end they\u2019ll give you a mediation certificate, which you\u2019ll need if you still want to appeal.\n\n### If you do not want mediation\n\nYou still need to contact the mediation service to get a mediation certificate so that you can appeal.\n\nIf you do not have a mediation certificate you will need to tell the tribunal why.\n\n## Appeal on behalf of a child or young person \n\nYou can appeal on behalf of a child or young person if they are under [school leaving age](/know-when-you-can-leave-school).\n\nIf your child is over the school leaving age, they may be able to [appeal on their own behalf](/appeal-ehc-plan-decision/appeal-as-a-young-person) instead.\n\nThe tribunal must receive your appeal within 2 months of the date on the local authority\u2019s decision letter or a month from the date of the [mediation certificate](/appeal-ehc-plan-decision/before-you-appeal) \\- whichever is later. \n\n## Appeal online\n\nYou cannot appeal online if your child is in custody or your local authority has not carried out an an EHC assessment. You can appeal by post or email.\n\n[ Appeal now ](https://appeal-about-ehc-plan-decision.form.service.justice.gov.uk)\n\n## Appeal by post or email\n\nDownload and fill in [form SEND35](/government/publications/form-send35-special-educational-needs-and-disability-tribunal-appeal).\n\nThere\u2019s a different form if:\n\n  * you\u2019re appealing a local authority\u2019s decision not to carry out an EHC assessment ([form SEND35A](/government/publications/form-send35a-special-educational-needs-and-disability-tribunal-appeal-a-refusal-to-secure-an-ehc-needs-assessment))\n  * your child\u2019s in custody and is [under school leaving age](/government/publications/form-send28-appeal-form-child-detained-in-youth-accommodation) or is [over school leaving age but under 18](/government/publications/form-send28a-appeal-form-young-person-under-18-detained-in-youth-accommodation)\n\n\n\n## What happens after you appeal\n\nThe tribunal will review your appeal and respond to you within 25 working days.\n\nWhen they respond, they\u2019ll tell you:\n\n  * if there will be a hearing\n\n  * more details about the hearing, if you\u2019ll have one\n\n  * the deadline for sending in more information about your appeal\n\n\n\n\nThe tribunal will send your appeal to the local authority who will have 30 working days to respond to you.\n\n## Change or withdraw your appeal\n\nYou can change or withdraw your appeal before the hearing.

They\u2019re an alternative to social care services provided by your local council.\n\nYou may also be eligible for extra [Child Tax Credit](/child-tax-credit) for each disabled child you\u2019re responsible for or [Disability Living Allowance for children](/disability-living-allowance-children).\n\n## Help if you\u2019re on a low income\n\nYou may be able to get a Family Fund grant if you\u2019re raising a disabled or seriously ill child or young person. This can help pay for things like:\n\n  * furniture and household products\n  * clothing and toys\n  * family breaks and days out\n\n\n\nFamily Fund will assess your finances to see if you\u2019re eligible.\n\nYou can find more information about grants on the [Family Fund website](https://www.familyfund.org.uk/).\n\nYou can also contact:\n\nFamily Fund   \nTelephone: 01904 550055   \nMonday to Friday, 9:30am to 5pm  \n[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)\n\n## Childcare \n\nYour local council\u2019s [Family Information Service](/find-family-information-service) can give you details about childcare in your local area.\n\nYou can also ask them about other specialist services that your child may need because of their disability.\n\n## Help with childcare costs\n\nAll 3 and 4 year olds are entitled to 15 hours of free education for 38 weeks of the year - read the information on [childcare and tax credits](/childcare-tax-credits) for more details.\n\nSome 2-year-olds (even if they have an education, health and care plan or get Disability Living Allowance) are also entitled to the [15 hours of free education](/free-early-education).\n\nYou can also get [direct payments](/apply-direct-payments) from your local council to help pay for childcare.\n\nIf you\u2019re working, you may be able to get up to \u00a34,000 a year to help pay for childcare for a disabled child through [Tax-Free Childcare](/tax-free-childcare).\n\n## Education \n\nUnder the [Equality Act 2010,](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/part/6) it\u2019s against the law for schools and other education providers to discriminate against disabled children.\n\nExamples of discrimination include:\n\n  * a school refusing to admit a disabled child just because of their disability\n  * stopping a disabled pupil going outside at break time because it takes them longer to get there\n\n\n\n[Contact the Equality Advisory Support Service](/equality-advisory-support-service) if you think your child has been discriminated against because of their disability.\n\n## Making \u2018reasonable adjustments\u2019\n\nSchools have to make \u2018reasonable adjustments\u2019 for disabled children. These can include:\n\n  * changes to physical features, for example adding a ramp\n  * changes to how learners are assessed\n  * providing extra support and aids, for example specialist teachers or equipment\n\n\n\n## Special educational needs\n\nSome children may have [special educational needs](/children-with-special-educational-needs) because their disabilities affect their ability to learn.\n\nYou can ask your council to carry out an [education, health and care (EHC) needs assessment](/children-with-special-educational-needs/extra-SEN-help) for your child. They may get an [EHC plan](/children-with-special-educational-needs/extra-SEN-help), which will explain the extra support they need.\n\nThe council must make sure your child gets this support.\n\nAsk to see a school\u2019s policy on special educational needs so you know what support they can offer.\n\n[Find your local support service](https://councilfordisabledchildren.org.uk/about-us-0/networks/information-advice-and-support-services-network/find-your-local-ias-service) if you need impartial advice about special educational needs.\n\n## Motability scheme \n\nThe Motability Scheme can help you lease a car if your child is aged 3 or over and is entitled to either the:\n\n  * higher rate of the mobility component of [Disability Living Allowance](/dla-disability-living-allowance-benefit)\n  * enhanced mobility component of [Personal Independence Payment](/pip)\n\n\n\nMore information about the scheme is on the [Motability website](https://www.motability.co.uk/about/how-the-scheme-works/).\n\nYou can also contact:\n\nThe Motability Scheme\n\nTelephone: 0300 456 4566   \nTextphone: 0300 037 0100   \nMonday to Friday, 8am to 7pm   \nSaturday, 9am to 1pm\n\n[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)\n\n## Home adaptations \n\nIf your home needs to be adapted to meet your child\u2019s needs, you may be able to get a [Disabled Facilities Grant](/disabled-facilities-grants) to help with the costs.\n\nUsually, an occupational therapist will talk to you to work out what adaptations would be best for your child.\n\nA Disabled Facilities Grant will not affect any benefits that you\u2019re getting.\n  *[EHC]: education, health and care",

      "body": "## How it works \n\nYou get Child Benefit if you\u2019re responsible for bringing up a child who is:\n\n  * under 16\n  * under 20 if they stay in approved [education or training](/child-benefit-16-19)\n\n\n\nOnly one person can get Child Benefit for a child.\n\nThere\u2019s no limit to how many children you can claim for.\n\nThis guide is also available [in Welsh (Cymraeg)](/budd-dal-plant).\n\nBy claiming Child Benefit, you can get:\n\n  * an allowance paid to you for each child - you\u2019ll usually get it every 4 weeks\n  * [National Insurance credits](/national-insurance-credits) which count towards your [State Pension](/state-pension)\n  * a National Insurance number for your child without them having to apply for one - they\u2019ll usually get the number shortly before they turn 16 years old\n\n\n\nIf you choose not to get Child Benefit payments, you should still make a claim to get the other advantages.\n\n## Child Benefit and protecting your State Pension\n\nYou\u2019ll get [National Insurance credits](/national-insurance-credits/overview) automatically if you claim Child Benefit and your child is under 12.\n\nThese credits count towards your State Pension, so you do not have gaps in your National Insurance record if either:\n\n  * you\u2019re not working\n  * you do not earn enough to pay National Insurance contributions\n\n\n\nIf you do not need the National Insurance credits, your family may be eligible to get the support instead. Either:\n\n  * your husband, wife or partner can [apply to transfer the credits](/government/publications/national-insurance-credits-for-parents-and-carers-cf411a)\n  * a different family member who provides care for your child can [apply for Specified Adult Childcare credits](/government/publications/national-insurance-credits-for-adults-who-care-for-a-child-under-12-fact-sheet/specified-adult-childcare-credits-fact-sheet)\n\n\n\n## If your circumstances change\n\nYou must [report any change of circumstances](/report-changes-child-benefit) to the Child Benefit Office.\n\n## What you'll get \n\nThere are 2 Child Benefit rates.\n\nWho the allowance is for | Rate (weekly)  \n---|---  \nEldest or only child | \u00a325.60  \nAdditional children | \u00a316.95 per child  \n  \nYou must [contact the Child Benefit Office](/contact/hm-revenue-customs/child-benefit) if you\u2019re paid too much or too little.\n\nAny Child Benefit payments you get will count towards the [benefit cap](/benefit-cap). If you\u2019re affected by the cap, you\u2019ll still get the full amount for your Child Benefit payments but your other benefits may be reduced.\n\n## If families split up\n\nIf a family splits up, you get \u00a325.60 a week for the eldest child.\n\nIf you have 2 children and one lives with you and the other lives with  \nsomeone else (for example, your ex-partner), you\u2019ll each get \u00a325.60 a week.\n\nIf you both claim for the same child, only one of you will get Child Benefit for them.\n\nIf you\u2019re entitled to Child Benefit for any other children, you\u2019ll get \u00a316.95 for each child.\n\n## If families join together\n\nIf you move in with a partner who also claims Child Benefit, you get \u00a325.60 for the eldest child in the household. You get \u00a316.95 for any younger children.\n\nYou and your partner can claim for different children. If you live together, you cannot both claim at the higher rate - you may have to pay back some of the money if you do.\n\nYou must [report the change to your family circumstances](/government/publications/child-benefit-change-of-family-circumstances).\n\n## If you or your partner earn over \u00a360,000\n\nIf either your or your partner\u2019s \u2018adjusted net income\u2019 is over \u00a360,000 a year, you may have to pay the [High Income Child Benefit Charge](/child-benefit-tax-charge).\n\nYour adjusted net income is your total [taxable income](/income-tax) before any personal allowances and less things like Gift Aid. Your total taxable income includes interest from savings and dividends.\n\nIf you have to pay the charge, you can still get the other advantages of Child Benefit like National Insurance credits. The charge will not be more than the amount you get from the Child Benefit payments.\n\nWork out if your adjusted net income is over \u00a360,000 using the [Child Benefit tax calculator](/child-benefit-tax-calculator). If it is, the calculator will also tell you how much of a charge you\u2019ll have to pay.\n\nIf both you and your partner have an individual income of over \u00a360,000, then whoever has the higher adjusted net income is responsible for paying the charge.\n\nIf either you or your partner has an individual income of \u00a380,000 or over, you\u2019ll be charged the same amount as you make through Child Benefit payments. You\u2019ll end up with no extra money from Child Benefit.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to fill in a Self Assessment tax return each tax year to pay the charge.\n\nYou can make a claim and [opt out of getting payments](/child-benefit-tax-charge/stop-child-benefit) if you do not want to pay the charge.

      "body": "## What PIP is for \n\nPersonal Independence Payment (PIP) can help with extra living costs if you have both:\n\n  * a long-term physical or mental health condition or disability\n\n  * difficulty doing certain everyday tasks or getting around because of your condition\n\n\n\n\nYou can get PIP even if you\u2019re working, have savings or are getting most other benefits.\n\nYou can also read about [PIP in Welsh (Cymraeg)](/taliad-annibyniaeth-personol-pip).\n\n## How PIP works\n\nThere are 2 parts to PIP:\n\n  * a daily living part - if you need help with everyday tasks\n  * a mobility part - if you need help with getting around\n\n\n\nWhether you get one or both parts and [how much you get](/pip/how-much-youll-get) depends on how difficult you find everyday tasks and getting around.\n\nIf you\u2019re nearing the end of life (for example, due to a life-limiting illness), you\u2019ll automatically get the daily living part. Whether you get the mobility part depends on your needs. Find out [how to claim and how much you\u2019ll get if you\u2019re nearing the end of life](/pip/claiming-end-of-life).\n\n### Daily living part\n\nYou might get the daily living part of PIP if you need help with:\n\n  * preparing food\n  * eating and drinking\n  * managing your medicines or treatments\n  * washing and bathing\n  * using the toilet\n  * dressing and undressing\n  * reading\n  * managing your money\n  * socialising and being around other people\n  * talking, listening and understanding\n\n\n\n### Mobility part\n\nYou might get the mobility part of PIP if you need help with:\n\n  * working out a route and following it\n  * physically moving around\n  * leaving your home\n\n\n\nYou do not have to have a physical disability to get the mobility part. You might also be eligible if you have difficulty getting around because of a cognitive or mental health condition, like anxiety.\n\n### How difficulty with tasks is assessed\n\nThe Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will assess how difficult you find daily living and mobility tasks. For each task they\u2019ll look at:\n\n  * whether you can do it safely\n  * how long it takes you\n  * how often your condition affects this activity\n  * whether you need help to do it, from a person or using extra equipment\n\n\n\nYour carer could get [Carer\u2019s Allowance](https://www.gov.uk/carers-allowance) if you have substantial caring needs.\n\n## Help with PIP\n\nIf you need help understanding or applying for PIP you can:\n\n  * [get help from Citizens Advice](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/sick-or-disabled-people-and-carers/pip/)\n  * watch [PIP video guides with British Sign Language](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC0aQWFFHARy_lYZbrnJfuXzhKWotacfM)\n  * use [easy read guides which explain PIP](/government/publications/about-pip-what-it-is-and-how-to-claim-it-easy-read-guide)\n\n\n\n## If you live in Scotland\n\nYou need to [apply for Adult Disability Payment (ADP)](https://www.mygov.scot/adult-disability-payment) instead of PIP.\n\nIf you currently get PIP, you\u2019ll be automatically moved to ADP by spring 2025.\n\nWhen the move begins, you\u2019ll get letters from DWP and Social Security Scotland. [Read more about the moving process](https://www.mygov.scot/personal-independence-payment-is-moving).\n\n### If you move from Scotland to England or Wales\n\nIf you get ADP and move from Scotland to England or Wales, you must make a new claim for PIP instead.\n\nYour ADP will stop 13 weeks after you move \u2013 apply for PIP as soon as possible after moving or your payments could be affected.\n\n## If you get Disability Living Allowance (DLA)\n\n[Disability Living Allowance (DLA)](/dla-disability-living-allowance-benefit) is being replaced by PIP for most adults. You\u2019ll keep getting DLA if:\n\n  * you\u2019re under 16\n  * you were born on or before 8 April 1948\n\n\n\nIf you were born after 8 April 1948, DWP will invite you to apply for PIP. You do not need to do anything until DWP writes to you about your DLA unless your circumstances change.\n\n## Eligibility \n\nYou can get Personal Independence Payment (PIP) if all of the following apply to you:\n\n  * you\u2019re 16 or over\n  * you have a long-term physical or mental health condition or disability\n  * you have [difficulty doing certain everyday tasks or getting around](/PIP)\n  * you expect the difficulties to last for at least 12 months from when they started\n\n\n\nYou must also be under [State Pension age](/state-pension-age) if you\u2019ve not received PIP before.\n\nIf you live in Scotland, you need to [apply for Adult Disability Payment (ADP)](https://www.mygov.scot/adult-disability-payment) instead.\n\nIf you\u2019re over State Pension age, you can apply for [Attendance Allowance](/attendance-allowance) instead. Or if you\u2019ve received PIP before, you can still make a new claim if you were eligible for it in the year before you reached State Pension age.\n\nThere are different eligibility rules [if you\u2019re nearing the end of life](/pip/claiming-end-of-life) (for example, due to a life-limiting illness). You might be able to get PIP more quickly and at a higher rate.\n\n## If you get other benefits or income\n\nYou can get PIP at the same time as all other benefits, except [Armed Forces Independence Payment](/claim-for-injury-received-while-serving/armed-forces-independence-payment-afip).\n\nIf you get [Constant Attendance Allowance](/constant-attendance-allowance) you\u2019ll get less of the daily living part of PIP.\n\nIf you get [War Pensioners\u2019 Mobility Supplement](/guidance/war-pension-scheme-mobility-supplement-wpms) you will not get the mobility part of PIP.\n\nYou can get PIP if you\u2019re working or have savings.\n\n## If you\u2019ve recently returned from living abroad\n\nTo apply for PIP, you usually need to:\n\n  * have lived in England, Scotland or Wales for at least 2 of the last 3 years\n  * be living in one of these countries when you apply\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve recently returned from living in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein, you might be able to get PIP sooner.\n\n[Find out about PIP if you live in Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/personal-independence-payment).\n\n## If you live abroad\n\nYou might still be able to get PIP if you either:\n\n  * live in the [EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein](/claim-benefits-abroad/disability-benefits) \\- you can only get help with daily living tasks\n  * work in the Armed Forces, or are a family member of someone who does\n\n\n\n## If you\u2019re not a British citizen\n\nYou must:\n\n  * normally live in or show that you intend to settle in the UK, Ireland, the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands\n  * not be subject to [immigration control](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/immigration/non-eea-nationals-and-the-habitual-residence-test/are-you-subject-to-immigration-control/) (unless you\u2019re a sponsored immigrant)\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re from the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein, you and your family usually also need settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme to get PIP. The deadline to apply to the scheme was 30 June 2021 for most people, but you might still be able to apply. [Check if you can still apply to the EU Settlement Scheme](/settled-status-eu-citizens-families/who-can-apply).\n\nYou might still be able to get PIP if you\u2019re a refugee or have humanitarian protection status.\n\n## How much you\u2019ll get \n\nHow much Personal Independence Payment (PIP) you get depends on how difficult you find:\n\n  * everyday activities (\u2018daily living\u2019 tasks)\n  * getting around (\u2018mobility\u2019 tasks)\n\n\n\nFind out [what tasks count as daily living and mobility tasks](/PIP).\n\n##  PIP amounts\n\n| Lower weekly rate | Higher weekly rate  \n---|---|---  \nDaily living part | \u00a372.65 | \u00a3108.55  \nMobility part | \u00a328.70 | \u00a375.75  \n  \nPIP is tax free.

After that you\u2019ll continue to get paid as normal.\n\nAll benefits, pensions and allowances are paid into your [bank, building society or credit union account](/how-to-have-your-benefits-paid).\n\n## Other help you can get\n\nIf you get the mobility part of PIP, you might be eligible for a:\n\n  * [Blue Badge](/apply-blue-badge)\n  * [vehicle tax discount or exemption](/financial-help-disabled/vehicles-and-transport)\n  * [Motability Scheme vehicle](https://www.motability.co.uk/), if you get the higher mobility rate of PIP\n\n\n\nIf you get either the daily living or mobility part of PIP you\u2019re eligible for a [Disabled Persons Railcard](https://www.disabledpersons-railcard.co.uk/).\n\nYou may be able to get a discount on Council Tax and local bus travel.

Depending on the change, your PIP could go up, go down, stay the same or stop.\n\nYou could be taken to court or have to pay a penalty if you give wrong information or do not report a change straight away.\n\nYou must also contact the PIP enquiry line straight away if:\n\n  * your personal details change, for example your name, address, phone numbers, bank account or doctor\n  * someone is acting on your behalf and that person changes\n\n\n\n## How to report a change\n\nCall the \u2018PIP enquiry line\u2019.\n\nIf you need someone to help you, you can:\n\n  * ask for them to be added to your call - you cannot do this if you use textphone\n  * ask someone else to call on your behalf - you\u2019ll need to be with them when they call\n\n\n\nPIP enquiry line  \nTelephone: 0800 121 4433  \nTextphone: 0800 121 4493  \n[Relay UK](https://www.relayuk.bt.com/) (if you cannot hear or speak on the phone): 18001 then 0800 121 4433   \nBritish Sign Language (BSL) [video relay service](https://connect.interpreterslive.co.uk/vrs?ilc=DWP) if you\u2019re on a computer - find out how to [use the service on mobile or tablet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oELNMfAvDxw)  \nMonday to Friday, 9am to 5pm  \n[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)\n\n## If you\u2019ve been paid too much\n\nYou may have to repay the money if you:\n\n  * did not report a change straight away\n  * gave wrong information\n  * were overpaid by mistake\n\n\n\nFind out how to [repay the money you owe from benefit overpayment](/benefit-overpayments).\n\n## Claiming PIP if you\u2019re nearing the end of life \n\nIf you\u2019re nearing the end of life (for example, due to a life-limiting illness) you might be able to get Personal Independence Payment (PIP) more quickly and at a higher rate. \n\nThis is sometimes called \u2018special rules for end of life\u2019.\n\n## Eligibility\n\nYou\u2019re eligible to claim PIP under the special rules for end of life if:\n\n  * your doctor or medical professional has said that you might have 12 months or less to live\n\n  * you\u2019re aged 16 or over\n\n\n\n\nYou must also be under [State Pension age](/state-pension-age) if you\u2019ve not received PIP before.\n\nIt can be difficult to predict how long someone might live for. If a medical professional has not talked to you about this, you can still ask them to support your claim under the special rules for end of life.\n\nIf you live in Scotland, you may need to [apply for Adult Disability Payment (ADP)](https://www.mygov.scot/adult-disability-payment) instead. [Check if you are eligible for ADP](https://www.mygov.scot/adult-disability-payment/applicants).\n\n## What you\u2019ll get\n\nYou\u2019ll get the higher daily living part of \u00a3108.55 per week.\n\nWhether you get the mobility part and how much you\u2019ll get depends on your needs. The lower weekly rate is \u00a328.70 and the higher weekly rate is \u00a375.75.\n\n## How to claim\n\nYou can claim for yourself or someone else can do it for you.\n\n  1. Call the PIP claims line to start your claim.\n\n  2. Ask a medical professional for form SR1. They\u2019ll either fill it in and give the form to you or send it directly to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).\n\n  3. If you also claim Universal Credit, [sign in to your online account](/sign-in-universal-credit) and use your journal to say that you have sent an SR1 to DWP.\n\n\n\n\nYou will not need to go to a face-to-face assessment.\n\nIf you need someone to help you, you can:\n\n  * ask for them to be added to your call - you cannot do this if you use textphone\n  * ask someone else to call on your behalf - you\u2019ll need to be with them when they call\n\n\n\nPIP claims  \nTelephone: 0800 917 2222  \nTextphone: 0800 917 7777  \n[Relay UK](https://www.relayuk.bt.com/) (if you cannot hear or speak on the phone): 18001 then 0800 917 2222  \nBritish Sign Language (BSL) [video relay service](https://connect.interpreterslive.co.uk/vrs?ilc=DWP) if you\u2019re on a computer - find out how to [use the service on mobile or tablet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oELNMfAvDxw)  \nCalling from abroad: +44 191 218 7766   \nMonday to Friday, 9am to 5pm  \n[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)\n\nYou may also be able to get other [benefits if you\u2019re nearing the end of life](/benefits-end-of-life).\n  *[PIP]: Personal Independence Payment\n  *[DWP]: Department for Work and Pensions\n  *[ADP]: Adult Disability Payment\n  *[DLA]: Disability Living Allowance\n  *[JSA]: Jobseeker's Allowance\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance",

      "body": "## Overview \n\nYou may get a county court judgment (CCJ) or high court judgment if someone takes court action against you (saying you owe them money) and you do not respond.\n\nYou must [respond to the court claim](/respond-to-court-claim-for-money) by the date on the email or letter you receive.\n\nIf you get a judgment, this means that the court has formally decided that you owe the money.\n\nThe judgment will come in the post and will explain:\n\n  * how much you owe\n  * how to pay (in full or in instalments)\n  * the deadline for paying\n  * who to pay\n\n\n\n[Records of judgments](/county-court-judgments-ccj-for-debt/ccjs-and-your-credit-rating) are kept for 6 years unless you pay the full amount within a month - this can make it hard to get credit.\n\n## What you can do if you get a judgment\n\nIf you do owe the money, you\u2019ll need to pay it back. If you cannot afford to, you can ask to:\n\n  * change the terms of (\u2018vary\u2019) the judgment\n  * pay it back in instalments\n\n\n\nFind out what [options you have for paying the judgment](/county-court-judgments-ccj-for-debt/pay-the-judgment-if-you-do-owe-the-money).\n\nYou can apply for the judgment to be cancelled (or \u2018set aside\u2019) if:\n\n  * you do not owe the money\n  * you did not receive, or did not respond to, the original claim from the court saying you owed the money\n\n\n\nFind out [how to apply for the judgment to be cancelled](/county-court-judgments-ccj-for-debt/cancel-the-judgment).\n\nIf you get a judgment, do not ignore it - you could be taken back to court and forced to pay.\n\n## Court judgments for debt in Scotland\n\nThe law is different in Scotland - read [guidance from the Accountant in Bankruptcy](https://www.aib.gov.uk/) (Scotland\u2019s insolvency service).\n\n## Pay the judgment - if you do owe the money \n\nYou\u2019ll have to pay the person or business you owe the money to, or their solicitor. The name and address will be on the judgment form. Do not pay the court.\n\nMake sure you can prove you\u2019ve paid. Send a cheque or postal order by post, or make a bank transfer. Do not send cash through the post.\n\nKeep a record of your payments and make sure you pay in time.\n\n## Pay in instalments\n\nIf you\u2019re paying in instalments, ask the person or business you owe the money to about the best way to pay.\n\nYou may want to set up a standing order to pay the money directly from your bank account.\n\nIf you\u2019re late with your payments, you could be taken back to court and you may have to pay extra costs.\n\n## Ask to change the payments\n\nYou can ask to change the terms of the judgment - for example, how and when you pay.\n\nTo do this, fill in the [N245 application form](/government/publications/form-n245-application-for-suspension-of-a-warrant-and-or-variation-of-an-order).\n\nGive details of your income and spending, and say how much you can realistically afford to pay.\n\nYou may have to pay a [court fee](/court-fees-what-they-are).\n\nIf your offer is rejected, the court will decide on the amount you have to pay.\n\n## If you do not pay what the court has ordered\n\nIf you do not pay as ordered, the person or business you owe money to may:\n\n  * threaten you with bailiffs to collect the money\n  * ask the court to take action against you to force you to pay\n\n\n\nYou can get temporary protection from your creditors through the [\u2018Breathing Space\u2019 scheme](/options-for-paying-off-your-debts/breathing-space), while still making repayments. You\u2019ll need to apply through a debt adviser.\n\n### If you\u2019re threatened with bailiffs\n\nThe person or business you owe money to may use bailiffs to collect the money.\n\nThey\u2019ll have to apply to the court for a \u2018warrant\u2019, which will give the bailiff the right to visit your home or property. You\u2019ll be given 7 days to pay before they visit.\n\nYou may be able to stop the bailiff from visiting, by filling in the [N245 application form](/government/publications/form-n245-application-for-suspension-of-a-warrant-and-or-variation-of-an-order).\n\nSay on the form how you\u2019ll repay the money - for example weekly or monthly payments. If your offer is accepted, the warrant will be stopped as long as you keep up with the payments.\n\n### Actions the court can take against you to force you to pay\n\nThe court may decide to:\n\n  * order a deduction from your earnings\n  * freeze money in your bank or building society account\n  * deduct the money you owe when you sell your property (such as a house, land, stocks or shares)\n  * order you to come to court to answer questions about things like your earnings or employment status\n\n\n\n## If you have other judgments or debts\n\nIf you have another judgment against you, you can arrange to pay all your debts to the court in a single weekly or monthly payment.\n\nThis will stop people taking action against you to get their money - for example by sending bailiffs to your home.\n\nYou can only do this if your total debts are under \u00a35,000.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to fill in the [application for an administration order (N92)](/government/publications/form-n92-application-for-an-administration-order).\n\nContact the court if you cannot keep up with the payments.\n\n## Cancel the judgment \n\nIf you do not owe the money, you can ask the court to cancel the county court judgment (CCJ) or high court judgment. This is known as getting the judgment \u2018set aside\u2019.\n\nYou can also do this if you did not receive, or did not respond to, the original claim from the court saying you owed the money.\n\n## Apply to get the judgment set aside\n\nTo get a judgment set aside, fill in the [application notice (N244)](/government/publications/form-n244-application-notice) and send it to the court.\n\nYou may have to pay a [court fee](/court-fees-what-they-are) of \u00a3303.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to go to a private hearing at the court to explain why you do not owe the money.\n\nIf you do not go to the hearing, your application will be rejected and you\u2019ll have to pay the amount in the judgment.\n\n## CCJs and your credit rating \n\nIf you get a county court judgment (CCJ) or a high court judgment, it will stay on the Register of Judgments, Orders and Fines for 6 years.\n\nBanks and loan companies use this information to decide whether to give you credit or loans.\n\n## If you pay within one month\n\nIf you pay the full amount within one month, you can get the judgment removed from the register.\n\nWrite to the court to say you\u2019ve paid. You\u2019ll need to send proof of payment from the person or business you owed money to.\n\n## If you pay after one month\n\nIf you pay after one month, you can get the record of the judgment marked as \u2018satisfied\u2019 in the register.\n\nIt will stay on the register for 6 years but people searching the register will see that you\u2019ve paid.\n\nWrite to the court to say you\u2019ve paid. You\u2019ll need to send proof of payment from the person or business you owed money to.\n\n## Getting a certificate of cancellation or satisfaction\n\nIf you want proof from the court that you\u2019ve paid, you can apply for:\n\n  * a certificate of cancellation - if you paid within one month\n  * a certificate of satisfaction - if you paid after one month\n\n\n\nApply for the certificate in writing or by [sending form N443](/government/publications/form-n443-application-for-a-certificate-of-satisfaction-or-cancellation) to the court that is dealing with your case.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to include a cheque for \u00a315 - make it payable to \u2018HMCTS\u2019. If you want to pay by card, contact the court that\u2019s handling your case.\n\n### If you cannot get proof of payment\n\nIf you cannot get proof from the person or business you owed money to, you can still apply for a certificate of cancellation or satisfaction using form N443.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to send evidence to the court showing you made the payment, for example a bank statement. If you do not have evidence, explain this on the form.\n\nThe court will write to the person or business you owed money to. If they do not respond within 30 days, the court will use your evidence to make a decision.\n\n## Search the register of judgments\n\nYou can search for details of any judgments against you on the [register of judgments](http://www.trustonline.org.uk).\n\nYou\u2019ll have to pay a small fee - each search costs between \u00a36 and \u00a310.\n\nIf the information on the register is wrong, [contact the court](https://www.gov.uk/find-court-tribunal) where the judgment was made.\n  *[CCJ]: county court judgment\n  *[HMCTS]: HM Courts & Tribunals Service",

      "body": "## What you can do when a bailiff visits \n\nA bailiff (\u2018enforcement agent\u2019) may visit your home if you do not pay your debts - such as Council Tax bills, parking fines, court fines and county court, high court or family court judgments.\n\nThis will happen if you ignore letters saying that bailiffs will be used.\n\nThere are different kinds of bailiffs, known as:\n\n  * \u2018certificated enforcement agents\u2019 (also known as \u2018civil enforcement agents\u2019)\n  * \u2018high court enforcement officers\u2019\n  * \u2018county court and family court bailiffs\u2019\n  * bailiffs who enforce magistrates\u2019 court fines and warrants for arrests (either \u2018civilian enforcement officers\u2019 or \u2018Approved Enforcement Agents\u2019)\n\n\n\nA bailiff may also visit your home for other reasons, for example to serve court documents or give notices and summons.\n\nAn Approved Enforcement Agent can arrest you if there\u2019s a warrant for your arrest for breaking a community penalty order.\n\nBailiffs must usually give you at least 7 days\u2019 notice of their first visit.\n\nThere\u2019s a different process in [Scotland](https://www.mygov.scot/your-rights-sheriff-officers/).\n\n## Pay what you owe before a bailiff visits\n\nIf you think a bailiff might visit you to collect debts, you can stop this by paying the money you owe.

This includes nursery school fees.\n\nYou cannot get help paying for:\n\n  * your child\u2019s compulsory education\n  * private lessons during school time (for example, private music lessons during school hours)\n\n\n\nYou cannot claim for [free childcare if you\u2019re working](/check-eligible-free-childcare-if-youre-working) for care outside school hours if your child is attending a state-funded school nursery or reception class. You may be able to claim if your child is attending an independent school nursery or reception class.\n\n## Childcare provided by relatives\n\n### If you live in England or Scotland\n\nYou can only get [Tax-Free Childcare](/tax-free-childcare) to help pay for childcare provided by a relative (for example, a grandparent) if they\u2019re a registered childminder and care for your child outside your home.\n\nYou cannot claim for [free childcare if you\u2019re working](https://www.gov.uk/check-eligible-free-childcare-if-youre-working) for childcare provided by a relative (for example, a grandparent).\n\nYou cannot get help for childcare provided by your partner. This is not accepted as \u2018approved childcare\u2019.\n\nIf you live in England and get free childcare if you\u2019re working, you can pay the childcare provider using Universal Credit, tax credits, childcare vouchers or Tax-Free Childcare.\n\n### If you live in Northern Ireland\n\nYou can only get help paying for childcare provided by a relative if all of the following apply:\n\n  * they\u2019re in a [childcare approval scheme in Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/home-childcarers)\n  * they care for your child outside your home\n  * they care for at least one other child that is not related to you\n\n\n\n### If you live in Wales\n\nYou can only get help paying for childcare provided by a relative if they\u2019re a registered childminder and care for your child outside your home.\n\n## Foster carers\n\nIf you\u2019re a foster parent of a child aged 9 months to 4 years old you can claim [free childcare if you\u2019re working](/check-eligible-free-childcare-if-youre-working) as long as:\n\n  * you\u2019re in paid work outside your fostering role \n  * your [adjusted net income](/guidance/adjusted-net-income) is under \u00a3100,000\n\n\n\nTo apply, speak to both your social worker and your [local authority](https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council).\n\n### Childcare provided by a foster carer\n\nYou can only claim [Tax-Free Childcare](/tax-free-childcare) if you\u2019re registered as a childcare provider and live in England.\n\nYou may be able to claim if a foster carer [provides childcare in Wales](/hmrc-internal-manuals/tax-credits-technical-manual/tctm02630#IDATLFXE), [provides childcare in Scotland](/hmrc-internal-manuals/tax-credits-technical-manual/tctm02630#IDADIFXE) or [provides childcare in Northern Ireland](/hmrc-internal-manuals/tax-credits-technical-manual/tctm02630#IDAXOFXE).\n\n## 15 hours free childcare for 3 and 4-year-olds \n\nAll 3 to 4-year-olds in England can get 570 free hours per year. It\u2019s usually taken as 15 hours a week for 38 weeks of the year. You can choose to take fewer hours over more weeks, if your childcare provider offers this option.\n\nSome 3 to 4-year-olds are eligible for 30 hours free childcare a week. [Check if you\u2019re eligible and find out how to apply](/apply-30-hours-free-tax-free-childcare).\n\nThe free early education and childcare:\n\n  * must be with an [approved childcare provider](/help-with-childcare-costs/what-counts-approved-childcare)\n  * stops when your child starts in reception class (or reaches compulsory school age, if later)\n\n\n\nYou can get it from the term after your child\u2019s 3rd birthday, starting on 1 January, 1 April or 1 September.\n\nYou may have to pay for extra costs such as:\n\n  * meals\n  * nappies\n  * additional hours\n  * additional activities, such as trips\n\n\n\nAsk your provider what extra costs you will have to pay for.\n\nContact your childcare provider or [local council](/find-free-early-education) to find out more.\n\nThis guide is also available [in Welsh (Cymraeg)](/help-gyda-chostau-gofal-plant/gofal-plant-ac-addysg-yn-rhad-ac-am-ddim-i-blant-2-i-4-oed).\n\n## Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland\n\nThere are [different schemes in Scotland](https://www.mygov.scot/childcare-costs-help/funded-early-learning-and-childcare), [different schemes in Wales](https://gov.wales/childcare-3-and-4-year-olds) and [different schemes in Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/childcare).\n\n## Free education and childcare for 2-year-olds if you claim certain benefits \n\nYour 2-year-old can get free childcare if you live in England and get any of the following benefits:\n\n  * Income Support\n  * income-based Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA)\n  * income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)\n  * Universal Credit, and your household income is \u00a315,400 a year or less after tax, not including benefit payments\n  * the guaranteed element of Pension Credit\n  * Child Tax Credit, Working Tax Credit (or both), and your household income is \u00a316,190 a year or less before tax\n  * the Working Tax Credit 4-week run on (the payment you get when you stop qualifying for Working Tax Credit)\n\n\n\nThis guide is also available [in Welsh (Cymraeg)](/help-gyda-chostau-gofal-plant/gofal-plant-yn-rhad-ac-am-ddim-i-blant-2-oed).\n\n2-year-olds can also get free childcare if they:\n\n  * are looked after by a local authority\n  * have an education, health and care (EHC) plan\n  * get [Disability Living Allowance](https://www.gov.uk/disability-living-allowance-children)\n  * have left care under an adoption order, special guardianship order or a child arrangements order\n\n\n\nYou may have to pay for extra costs such as:\n\n  * meals\n  * nappies\n  * additional hours\n  * additional activities, such as trips\n\n\n\nAsk your provider what extra costs you will have to pay for.\n\nContact your childcare provider or [local council](/find-free-early-education) to find out more.\n\n## If you\u2019re not eligible for free education and childcare for parents getting benefits\n\nYou may be able to get [free childcare if you\u2019re working](/apply-free-childcare-if-youre-working) under a separate scheme.\n\n## If you\u2019re eligible for both schemes\n\nYou can only get help from either: \n\n  * free education and childcare for parents getting benefits\n  * [free childcare if you\u2019re working](/apply-free-childcare-if-youre-working)\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re eligible for both, you must apply for help through the free education and childcare for parents getting benefits scheme.\n\n## If you\u2019re a non-UK citizen who cannot claim benefits\n\nIf your immigration status says you have \u2018no recourse to public funds\u2019, you may still get free childcare for your 2-year-old. You must live in England and your household income after tax must be no more than:\n\n  * \u00a326,500 for families outside of London with one child\n  * \u00a334,500 for families within London with one child\n  * \u00a330,600 for families outside of London with two or more children\n  * \u00a338,600 for families within London with two or more children\n\n\n\nYou cannot have more than \u00a316,000 in savings or investments.\n\nContact your childcare provider or check with your [local council](https://www.gov.uk/find-free-early-education) if you\u2019re unsure if you can get free childcare.\n\n## Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland\n\nThere are [different schemes in Scotland](https://www.mygov.scot/childcare-costs-help/funded-early-learning-and-childcare), [different schemes in Wales](https://gov.wales/get-help-flying-start) and [different schemes in Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/childcare).\n\n## Tax credits and childcare \n\nIf you already claim tax credits, you can add [an extra amount of Working Tax Credit](/working-tax-credit/what-youll-get) to help cover the cost of childcare.\n\nThis guide is also available [in Welsh (Cymraeg)](/help-gyda-chostau-gofal-plant/credydau-treth).\n\nBoth of the following must apply:\n\n  * your child is in [approved childcare](/help-with-childcare-costs)\n  * the childcare is provided in-person, not online\n\n\n\nIf you have a child and you\u2019re already claiming Working Tax Credit, you can also claim [Child Tax Credit](/child-tax-credit).\n\n## Update your tax credit claim to get help with childcare\n\n[Contact HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)](/contact/hm-revenue-customs/tax-credits-enquiries) to update your tax credit claim - you do not need a claim form.\n\nYou must tell HMRC about [changes to your circumstances](/changes-affect-tax-credits), for example your childcare costs stop or change by an average of \u00a310 or more a week.\n\nYou must [renew your claim](/renewing-your-tax-credits-claim) every year. You\u2019ll get a reminder.\n\n## Universal Credit and childcare \n\nYou may be able to claim back up to 85% of your childcare costs if you\u2019re eligible for [Universal Credit](/universal-credit/eligibility).\n\nThis guide is also available [in Welsh (Cymraeg)](/help-gyda-chostau-gofal-plant/credyd-cynhwysol).\n\nYou (and your partner if you live with them) will usually need to either:\n\n  * be working - it does not matter how many hours you or your partner work\n  * have a job offer\n\n\n\n## How much you\u2019ll get\n\nThe most you can get back each month is:\n\n  * \u00a31,014.63 for one child\n  * \u00a31,739.37 for 2 or more children\n\n\n\nYou can [claim Universal Credit online](/apply-universal-credit).\n\n## If you stop working\n\nIf you stop working you must report a change of circumstances in [your Universal Credit account](/sign-in-universal-credit).\n\n## Childcare vouchers and other employer schemes \n\nThe following schemes are closed to new applicants:\n\n  * childcare vouchers\n  * childcare your employer arranges with a provider (known as \u2018directly contracted childcare\u2019)\n\n\n\nIf you joined one of these schemes on or before 4 October 2018 you might be able to keep getting vouchers or directly contracted childcare.\n\nThis guide is also available [in Welsh (Cymraeg)](/help-gyda-chostau-gofal-plant/talebau-gofal-plant).\n\n## If you joined a childcare voucher scheme or a directly contracted childcare scheme on or before 4 October 2018\n\nYou can keep getting vouchers or directly contracted childcare as long as:\n\n  * your wages were adjusted on or before 4 October 2018\n  * you stay with the same employer and they continue to run the scheme\n  * you do not take an unpaid career break of longer than a year\n\n\n\nYou can take up to \u00a355 a week of your wages, which you do not pay tax or National Insurance on.\n\nHow much you can take depends on the amount you earn and when you joined the scheme.\n\nIf the business you work for changes owner, your [employee rights are usually protected](/transfers-takeovers). Check with your new employer if you can still get vouchers or directly contracted childcare.\n\n### If you get Tax-Free Childcare\n\nYou cannot continue to claim childcare vouchers or directly contracted childcare if you successfully apply for Tax-Free Childcare.\n\nWhich scheme you\u2019re better off with depends on your situation. Use the [childcare calculator](/childcare-calculator) to work out which type of support is best for you.\n\nYou must tell your employer within 90 days if you get Tax-Free Childcare. They\u2019ll then stop giving you new vouchers or directly contracted childcare.\n\nYou can continue to use any vouchers you already have, including to make a joint payment for childcare with Tax-Free Childcare. There\u2019s no deadline for using your vouchers or directly contracted childcare.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve told your employer that you\u2019re getting Tax-Free Childcare, you cannot rejoin their voucher scheme or their directly contracted childcare scheme.\n\n## Tax and employer childcare schemes\n\nYou do not have to pay tax and National Insurance on:\n\n  * childcare vouchers, if you joined a scheme and your wages were adjusted on or before 4 October 2018\n  * directly contracted childcare, if you joined a scheme and your wages were adjusted on or before 4 October 2018\n  * workplace nurseries\n\n\n\nYou must pay tax and National Insurance on:\n\n  * cash your employer gives you to pay for childcare\n  * childcare provider\u2019s fees your employer pays\n  * school fees your employer pays\n\n## Help with childcare while you study \n\n## School or sixth form\n\nYou could get weekly payments through [Care to Learn](/care-to-learn) if you\u2019re under 20 at the start of a publicly-funded course, for example at school or sixth form.\n\nThis guide is also available [in Welsh (Cymraeg)](/help-gyda-chostau-gofal-plant/cymorth-wrth-astudio).\n\n## Further education\n\nYou can apply for [Learner Support](/learner-support) to pay for childcare if you\u2019re 20 or over and in further education, for example studying for an NVQ, BTEC or PGCE.\n\nYou could also get weekly payments through [Care to Learn](/care-to-learn).\n\n## Full-time higher education\n\nYou can apply for a [Childcare Grant](/childcare-grant) if you\u2019re in full-time higher education to pay for childcare costs for children:\n\n  * under 15\n  * under 17 if they have special needs\n\n\n  *[JSA]: Jobseeker's Allowance\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[EHC]: education, health and care\n  *[HMRC]: HM Revenue and Customs",

This is because 85% of your costs is \u00a3195.50, which is above the maximum weekly amount.\n\nYou have to pay any remaining costs.\n\n## 2023 to 2024 academic year\n\nYou can get 85% of your childcare costs or a fixed maximum amount, whichever is less.\n\nThe maximum you can get is:\n\n  * up to \u00a3188.90 a week for 1 child\n\n  * up to \u00a3323.85 a week for 2 or more children\n\n\n\n\n## How you\u2019re paid\n\nYour grant will be paid into a Childcare Grant Payment Service (CCGPS) account. You\u2019ll get an email telling you how to set one up.\n\nYour childcare provider will send requests for payment to the CCGPS, which you can approve through your account. You\u2019ll usually need to do this every week. Your provider will be paid directly from the money in your account.\n\nYou can only approve payments to your childcare provider once your course has started. You cannot use the Childcare Grant to pay for upfront costs such as deposits.\n\nAny money that\u2019s left over at the end of the academic year will be returned to Student Finance England.\n\nIncome-related, unemployment and housing benefits are not affected by a Childcare Grant.\n\n## Eligibility \n\nTo qualify for a Childcare Grant all the following must apply:\n\n  * you\u2019re a full-time student\n  * your child must be under 15, or under 17 if they have special educational needs\n  * you get undergraduate student finance based on your household income (or are eligible for this)\n  * you\u2019re not getting a Postgraduate Loan\n  * you\u2019re a permanent resident in England\n  * your household income is less than \u00a319,795.23 - if you\u2019re applying for 1 child\n  * your household income is less than \u00a328,379.39 - if you\u2019re applying for 2 or more children\n  * neither you or your partner are claiming Tax-Free Childcare, the childcare element of working Tax Credit or Universal Credit\n  * neither you or your partner receive help with childcare costs from the NHS\n  * the children in your grant application are financially dependent on you\n  * your childcare provider is on the Ofsted Early Years Register or General Childcare Register - check with your provider\n\n\n\nIf your child is cared for at home, the carer cannot be a relative and must be registered with an appropriate body. Check with [Student Finance England](/contact-student-finance-england).\n\nA Childcare Grant is different to 15 or 30 hours free childcare. You cannot use it to pay for those hours.\n\n## How to apply \n\nTo apply for a Childcare Grant follow these steps:\n\n  1. Apply online as part of your main student finance application.\n\n  2. Send in evidence. You\u2019ll be told what evidence you need to provide when you apply.\n\n  3. You\u2019ll be sent a letter telling you how much Childcare Grant you\u2019ll get.\n\n  4. Create an online account with the Childcare Grant Payment Service (CCGPS). You\u2019ll get an email telling you how to set one up. Your grant will be paid into this account.\n\n\n\n\nUse the paper form instead if you:\n\n  * have already applied for student finance but didn\u2019t apply for a childcare grant at the same time\n  * want to apply for another child\n\n\n\nYou can download the form from the [student finance form finder](/student-finance-forms).\n\nUse your [student finance account](/student-finance-register-login) to send the form to Student Finance England, or send it by post.\n\nStudent Finance England   \nPO Box 210   \nDarlington   \nDL1 9HJ   \n\n  *[CCGPS]: Childcare Grant Payment Service\n  *[NHS]: National Health Service",
