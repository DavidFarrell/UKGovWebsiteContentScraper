And if you're like moving over to the UK from somewhere else, you gotta show a couple things, like you gotta basically live in the UK for real as your main place, unless you're off on holidays or something. Plus your kid\u2019s gotta be living with you, usually. Also, you need to have the right to live in the UK, which is a big deal. \n\nSo, if you have this \u2018settled\u2019 status from the EU Settlement Scheme, then hey, you can get Child Benefit. But if you just have \u2018pre-settled\u2019 status, you might wanna look at the [extra eligibility rules](#). Ugh, and there\u2019s also a Welsh version of all this if that\u2019s your jam, I guess.\n\nNow, if your kid doesn't actually live with you in the UK, normally you won\u2019t qualify if you're not from the EU, like if you're from outside the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, or that tiny one called Liechtenstein. That's a mouthful, right? So, if your kid is chilling in an EU country or one of those other EEA countries, you might still be in luck. You just need to either have that settled or pre-settled status or meet some other conditions from agreements with the EU or those Norway/Iceland/Liechtenstein buddies. It\u2019s all kinda complicated, I know, but stick with me!\n\nOh, and then, either you or your partner's gotta be paying UK National Insurance if you're working or getting something like JSA or Employment Support Allowance, all that good stuff. Those are pretty common benefits, you might have heard of them. Stuff like the State Pension or people getting support when their partners pass away (like a widow\u2019s benefit??).\n\nNext up, if you\u2019re \u2018subject to immigration control\u2019\u2014which sounds super serious\u2014you usually can\u2019t apply for Child Benefit. This is so if you either need permission to be in the UK and don\u2019t have it, or if you've got permission but can't access public funds. \n\nBut wait! There\u2019s a catch if you are from places like Albania, Morocco, Tunisia, or Turkey and you\u2019re working in the UK; you might actually be able to claim. Also, there are some countries that made agreements with the UK for Child Benefit. Here\u2019s a few: Barbados, Canada (hey, they\u2019re nice), New Zealand, and like a bunch of others. \n\nSo, check that out and see what fits your situation!

Real easy. \n- Or, you can just call them up or write them a letter to the Child Benefit Office. Yeah, that too.\n\nIf you\u2019re writing, make sure to put in:\n- Your National Insurance number (you need this).\n- Your full name, where you live, and your phone number, of course.\n- What exactly happened and when - like, details are kinda important?\n- Any reference numbers you might\u2019ve gotten earlier, don\u2019t forget those.\n- How you wanna fix the problem or whatever.\n- And don\u2019t forget, write \u2018complaint\u2019 up top, \u2018cause that\u2019s like, super key! \n\nThey\u2019ll usually get back to you in about 15 working days, or so they say.\n\n### If You\u2019re Still Unhappy\n\nIf you\u2019re still not cool with what they said back, just ask them to take another look at their response.

And you\u2019re probably gonna have to pay that money back, which is like such a pain. They\u2019ve got a different way to pay the High Income Child Benefit Tax Charge, but I guess that\u2019s another story.\n\nOh, by the way, this guide is also in Welsh, if that matters to you. \n\n## Overpaid Child Benefit - What Now?\n\nSo, if they paid you more than you should've gotten, the Child Benefit Office will hit you up with a letter. Like, they\u2019ll tell you:\n\n- You got paid too much\n- Why it happened\n- If you need to give it back or not \n- How to argue with them if you think they are totally wrong\n\nBut listen, if you think you're one of those overpaid people, just call the Child Benefit Office like right now. Don\u2019t just sit there and be all chill waiting for their letter. \n\nAnd seriously, don\u2019t ignore it! If you know you got too much money but you do nothing, you could get in big trouble for fraud, and nobody wants to go to jail, right? \n\n## Paying Back \n\nWhen it comes to paying back what you owe, usually, you'll pay it all in one shot, like a lump sum or whatever. So get that reference number they gave you \u2013 it\u2019s on your overpayment letter that HMRC sent. It\u2019s long and starts with a Y, like YA123456789123 or something.\n\nYou can pay online super easy:\n\n- Use a debit or corporate credit card\n- Or pay from your bank account through mobile or online banking \n\n[Pay now](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/pay/child-benefit-repayments/start-journey)\n\n### Paying by card\n\nIf you use a corporate card, there'll be a fee that you can\u2019t get back, which is lame. But if you use your personal debit card, it\u2019s all good, no fees there! Forget personal credit cards, they don\u2019t work for this.\n\n### Paying via your bank account\n\nTo pay online, you go to the repayment section and choose to pay through your bank account, which, I guess, is pretty simple if you know how to log in. The money goes usually right away but might take a couple of hours to show up in your account.\n\n### Bank transfer \n\nAnd another way is to do a bank transfer online or on the phone. It usually gets to HMRC same day or next day if you\u2019re lucky. Just remember to put your reference number in because otherwise they won\u2019t know it\u2019s you.\n\nHere are the details you need:\n\n- Sort code: 08 32 30\n- Account number: 11963279\n- Account name: HMRC Child Benefit Remittance\n\nThey\u2019re at Barclays Bank in London, but I mean, I guess you didn\u2019t really ask for that.\n\n### Can\u2019t pay online?\n\nIf you\u2019re like, totally struggling and can't find that reference number or want to pay with a card over the phone or need more time to pay, just call HMRC at 0300 322 9240. They\u2019re around Monday to Thursday from 8:30 am to 5 pm and Friday until 4:30 pm or something like that. \n\nSo yeah, don't let this stress you out too much, just deal with it!",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, like, you can usually get this thing called Child Benefit for, uh, 8 weeks after your kid goes to live with someone else, which could be like a friend or a family member. But, only if nobody else is claiming it. If you\u2019re chipping in for your kid\u2019s stuff, you might be able to keep getting it for a bit longer, which is good, I guess.\n\nThe Child Benefit Office or whatever will let you know if someone else tries to claim for your kid. They'll help figure out who should claim if you're kinda stuck on what to do, which is nice of them.\n\nOh, and by the way, there's actually a Welsh version of this guide, if you need that!\n\nNow, about the contributions or whatever\u2014so, if you're helping out with your kid\u2019s costs, like, clothes, food, presents, and even giving them some pocket money, you can get Child Benefit for more than 8 weeks as long as the money you contribute is at least as much as the Child Benefit amount. \n\nYou can pay like weekly, monthly, or just in one big chunk to cover a while, I think. If you miss a couple of payments, they might still count you as having paid for the whole time, which is kinda cool. Also, if you\u2019ve got more than one kid, they\u2019ll just split your contributions evenly, unless you ask them to do it differently, I guess.\n\nAnd listen, if more than one person is putting in money for the same kid, it still counts as long as together, you hit that minimum amount. \n\nNow, about court stuff: if you\u2019re paying maintenance for your kid because of some court order or agreement, that counts too for your Child Benefit, but only if it actually goes towards caring for the kid.\n\nOkay, so about who gets the money: only one person can claim Child Benefit for a kid, which seems fair, I guess. If you wanna change who is claiming, you need to contact the Child Benefit Office, sounds a little tedious, right?  So just tell them: first, that you want to stop getting it, then who you want to take over, and tell that person to make a new claim on their own. If you later want to start getting it again, you\u2019ll have to claim again, which is like, ugh, annoying.\n\nAlso, there's this thing where if you or your partner makes over \u00a360k, you might have to pay a tax charge, which is super fun. It\u2019s like, what even? You can use a Child Benefit tax calculator thing to see what you\u2019ve got and whether you\u2019ll have to cough up some cash. \n\nSo, yeah, keep all that in mind and make sure you communicate with the Child Benefit Office if things change or whatever!",

The father or pregnant woman\u2019s partner has the right to unpaid time off work to go to 2 antenatal appointments.\n\n## Pregnancy-related illnesses\n\nMaternity leave and Statutory Maternity Pay will start automatically if the employee is off work for a pregnancy-related illness in the 4 weeks before the baby is due - it does not matter what has been previously agreed.\n\n## Compulsory maternity leave\n\nIf the employee is not taking Statutory Maternity Leave, they must take 2 weeks off after the baby is born - or 4 weeks if they work in a factory.\n\n## Telling the employer about the pregnancy\n\nEmployees must tell their employer about the pregnancy at least 15 weeks before the beginning of the week the baby is due.\n\nIf this is not possible (for example because they did not know they were pregnant) the employer must be told as soon as possible.\n\nEmployees must also tell the employer when they want to start their [Statutory Maternity Leave](/maternity-pay-leave/leave) and [Statutory Maternity Pay](/maternity-pay-leave/pay).\n\nEmployees cannot take time off for antenatal appointments until they\u2019ve told the employer about the pregnancy.\n\n## Health and safety for pregnant employees\n\nWhen the employee tells their employer they\u2019re pregnant, the employer should assess the risks to the employee and their baby.\n\nRisks could be caused by:\n\n  * heavy lifting or carrying\n  * standing or sitting for long periods without adequate breaks\n  * exposure to toxic substances\n  * long working hours\n\n\n\nWhere there are risks, the employer should take reasonable steps to remove them. For example, offering the employee different work or changing their hours.\n\nThe employer should [suspend the employee on full pay](/running-payroll/payments) if they cannot remove any risks. For example, offering suitable alternative work.\n\nFor [full details about the regulations](https://www.hse.gov.uk/mothers/employer/workplace-safety-law.htm) see the Health and Safety Executive website.\n\nPregnant employees who think they\u2019re at risk but their employer disagrees should talk to their health and safety or trade union representative. If your employer still refuses to do anything, talk to your doctor or contact the [Health and Safety Executive.](http://www.hse.gov.uk/contact/index.htm)\n\n## Pregnancy and maternity discrimination\n\nIt is against the law to discriminate against anyone because of being pregnant.\n\nRead the Acas guide on [pregnancy and maternity discrimination](https://www.acas.org.uk/managing-your-employees-maternity-leave-and-pay/discrimination-because-of-pregnancy-or-maternity) for more information.\n\nPregnant employees have the right to be offered a suitable alternative job (if one is available) if they\u2019re selected for redundancy. This applies even if other colleagues are more suitable for the role.\n\nThe right starts from the date the employee tells their employer they\u2019re pregnant and lasts for up to 18 months from the date the child is born. If the pregnancy ends early and the employee does not have the right to statutory maternity leave, the right lasts for 2 weeks after the end of the pregnancy.\n\nFind out about [employee rights when taking maternity leave and returning to work](/employee-rights-when-on-leave).",

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so if you\u2019re pregnant and working, there\u2019s like four big main legal things you should know about, right?  \n  \n1. You gotta get paid time off for antenatal care, right?  \n2. Then there\u2019s maternity leave, like when you actually take time off after the baby\u2019s born.  \n3. Also, there\u2019s maternity pay or what they call maternity allowance or something similar.  \n4. Lastly, you can\u2019t be discriminated against or treated unfairly at work, like fired for being pregnant or whatever, that\u2019s just wrong.  \n  \nSo, when people say 'antenatal care,' it\u2019s kinda more than just going to the doctor. If your doc or midwife says you should go to parenting classes or other stuff, that\u2019s included! Crazy, huh?  \n  \nAnd actually, if you\u2019re pregnant, your boss can\u2019t just change your job contract without you saying it\u2019s cool. If they do that, they\u2019re breaking contract law or something like that.  \n  \nAlso, your employer has to give you time off for those antenatal appointments and still pay you your regular paycheck for it. And oh, the baby\u2019s dad or your partner can miss work too for two of those antenatal appointments but, like, unpaid though.  \n  \nNow, if you get sick because of the pregnancy in the last month before the baby\u2019s born, you\u2019ll automatically start your maternity leave and get your maternity pay, even if you didn\u2019t say you wanted to or anything, isn\u2019t that neat?  \n  \nAlso, here\u2019s the compulsory maternity leave thing: if you choose not to take your Statutory Maternity Leave, you still have to take two weeks off after the baby arrives, or like four weeks if you\u2019re in a factory or something.  \n  \nNow when it comes to telling your boss you\u2019re pregnant, you gotta let them know at least 15 weeks before the week when the baby\u2019s due. But, like, if you didn\u2019t know you were pregnant, just tell them as soon as you can, cool? Plus, you have to tell them when you wanna start your leave and your maternity pay too. Oh, and you can\u2019t take time off for antenatal appointments until you tell them about your pregnancy, just so you know.  \n  \nNext, about health and safety and all that\u2014once you let your employer know you\u2019re pregnant, they should check for any risks to you or the baby.  \nThose risks could be stuff like having to lift heavy things, standing too long without a break, being around toxic stuff, or working too many hours.  \nIf there are risks, the employer has to do something about it, like maybe assign you different tasks or change your hours or something.  \nIf they can\u2019t fix it, then they should put you on paid leave or move you to another job. There\u2019s more details about this at the Health and Safety Executive website if you wanna check that out.  \n  \nSo if you feel like you\u2019re in a risky spot at work and your employer thinks it\u2019s fine, just talk to your health and safety rep or union person. If they still don\u2019t listen, you might wanna go to your doctor or hit up the Health and Safety Executive again.  \n  \nAnd oh, here\u2019s the biggie: it\u2019s totally illegal to discriminate against you just for being pregnant!  \nRead up on pregnancy and maternity discrimination at Acas for more info.  \nIf they try to let you go and you\u2019re pregnant, you have the right to be offered a different position if there\u2019s one available\u2014even if other people are more suited for it, how wild is that?!  \nThis right kicks in as soon as you tell your employer you\u2019re expecting and lasts for like 18 months after the kiddo is born. If you lose the baby early and miss out on maternity leave, then you have two weeks right after that\u2014totally fair, right?  \nOh, and definitely look into your rights when taking maternity leave and when you come back to work because that\u2019s important too!",

      "body": "Employee rights are not usually affected when taking:\n\n  * maternity leave\n  * paternity leave\n  * adoption leave\n  * parental leave\n  * parental bereavement leave\n  * Shared Parental Leave\n\n\n\nSome employees can work up to 10 paid days (20 days for Shared Parental Leave) during their leave.\n\n## Keeping in touch days\n\nEmployees can work up to 10 days during their maternity or adoption leave. These days are called \u2018keeping in touch days\u2019. Keeping in touch days are optional - both the employee and employer need to agree to them.\n\nThe type of work and pay employees get should be agreed before they come into work. The employee\u2019s right to maternity or adoption leave and pay is not affected by taking keeping in touch days.\n\nEmployees can work up to 20 days during their Shared Parental Leave. These are called \u2018shared parental leave in touch\u2019 (or SPLIT) days. These days are in addition to the 10 \u2018keeping in touch\u2019 (or KIT) days already available to employees on maternity or adoption leave.\n\n## Terms and conditions protection\n\nNormally, the employment terms and conditions are protected and employees are entitled to any pay rises and improvements in terms and conditions given during the leave.\n\nPension contributions usually stop if a period of leave is unpaid, unless your contract says otherwise. For example, during unpaid periods of maternity leave or parental leave.\n\nEmployees continue to build up holiday entitlement and can take any holiday they\u2019ve accrued (built up) before or after the leave.\n\n## Returning to work\n\nEmployees have the right to return to their job if they take:\n\n  * paternity leave\n  * only 26 weeks of maternity or adoption leave\n  * only 26 weeks of Shared Parental Leave (between both parents)\n  * 4 weeks or less of unpaid parental leave\n  * Parental Bereavement Leave\n\n\n\n### If employees take more leave\n\nIf the employee takes more leave they\u2019ll have the right to their job or a similar job (if it\u2019s not possible to give them their old job).\n\nSimilar means the job has the same or better terms and conditions. If the employee unreasonably refuses to take the similar job the employer can take this as their resignation.\n\n## Redundancy\n\nEmployees have the right to be offered a suitable alternative job (where one is available) if they\u2019re selected for redundancy when they take:\n\n  * maternity leave\n  * adoption leave\n  * at least 6 continuous weeks Shared Parental Leave\n\n\n\nThis applies even if other colleagues are more suitable for the role.\n\nThe right lasts for 18 months from the date the child is born or adopted and continues when the employee returns to work. For example, an employee returning from maternity leave 12 months after the birth of their child will have the same right for 6 months after returning to work.\n\nSome employees only have the right to be offered a suitable alternative job up until they return to work. This applies if an employee:\n\n  * is taking less than 6 continuous weeks Shared Parental Leave\n  * returned to work before 6 April 2024\n\n\n\nAn employee can only be made redundant if the employer can clearly justify doing it - for example a part of the business closes and everyone in that section is made redundant. There are other [rules for employers](/staff-redundant) when making staff redundant.",

This is on top of those 10 KIT days for maternity or adoption leave. Kinda generous, right? \n\nAnd then there's terms and conditions stuff. Usually, your job stuff stays the same even while you're on leave, so if they\u2019re handing out pay raises or better working conditions while you\u2019re gone, you still get to enjoy that when you come back. Though, if your leave is unpaid, like if you\u2019re on unpaid maternity leave, your pension payments might stop unless your contract says otherwise. Totally worth checking! Plus, you keep racking up holiday days! So, don\u2019t forget to take those before or after you go on leave.\n\nSo, if you take paternity leave or just 26 weeks of maternity or adoption leave, or the same amount for Shared Parental Leave, you\u2019ve got the right to go back to your same job. Easy stuff! But if you take, like, more leave than that, you still get to come back but to a similar job instead. Similar means like it\u2019s just as good as your original job, or preferably better! If you say no to this similar job, your employer might think you just quit, so be careful there.\n\nOh, and redundancy stuff? If you're on maternity or adoption leave, or you\u2019ve taken at least 6 weeks of Shared Parental Leave, your employer has to offer you another suitable job if they start laying people off. That\u2019s fair, huh? This job offer rule sticks around for 18 months after your kid\u2019s born or adopted, so you\u2019re covered for a while. Even if some other people are better suited for that job, they gotta extend that offer to you because of your leave situation.\n\nBut um, if you\u2019re just taking less than 6 weeks of Shared Parental Leave or you scoot back to work before 6 April 2024, then you might not get the job offer when they\u2019re laying folks off. And also, if they wanna make you redundant, they have to have a good reason. Like if they\u2019re closing part of the business and that affects everybody there. There are some rules for employers about redundancy too, just so you know.",

It\u2019s like, super important and you can\u2019t really escape it. There\u2019s this thing called the Regulated Qualifications Framework, or RQF for short, where a bunch of qualifications are held. Kinda makes sense, right?\n\nIf you\u2019re older than 16 and you\u2019ve finished high school (or, well, dropped out, who knows?), you usually don\u2019t have to pay for a few courses. I mean, unless you find one that costs money, then that might suck. But, good news! You can usually take English or math up to GCSE level\u2014for free! Or, like, some computer courses if you\u2019re into that geek stuff. And also, English for speakers of other languages, or ESOL (what a mouthful) is also free or really cheap, depending on whether you\u2019ve got a job or how long you've been in England. Wild, right?\n\nIf you do end up having to pay for something, don\u2019t freak out. There\u2019s this thing called Learner Support that might help you out. Totally worth checking into.\n\nNow, if you're looking to find a course, you can use this thing called the National Careers Service course finder online. Or just give them a call! Their helpline's pretty chill. You can reach 'em at 0800 100 900, which is open from like 8 in the morning to 10 at night, every day! Not a bad deal! Just check for call charges, though, or you might end up paying more than you planned.\n\nOh, and if you want, you can even ask for an adviser to ring you up\u2014totally free.\n\nAs for places where you can learn all this stuff? Well, you can go to:\n- further education colleges, which is sorta like a step up from high school,\n- adult education centres where grown-ups go to learn something new,\n- some libraries or children\u2019s centres too, which is kinda neat,\n- or other training providers, whatever that means! \n\nSo yeah, there\u2019s a bunch of options out there if you wanna improve your skills. Just gotta find it!",

They might be able to fix your problem without all the fuss of making it a big deal. Like, keep it casual, you know? But, yeah, if that doesn\u2019t work out, you\u2019ve got this whole formal complaint thing you can do, but yeah, you gotta stick to what your organization says about it. \n\nNow, if you don\u2019t know how to make a complaint, just ask HR or your manager for the complaint rules or whatever. It\u2019s just basic stuff. \n\nSo, the complaint rules should say things like:\n- What stuff you need to send them to complain, you might need to fill out a form or throw in some evidence or something.\n- Where you need to send that stuff to.\n- How they\u2019ll handle it, who gets to look at your complaint, and what might happen next.\n- When you can expect to hear back about it, which is super important because everyone hates waiting forever, am I right?\n\nIf you're not cool with how they handled your complaint after all this, you can shout about it to the Education and Skills Funding Agency (or ESFA, just to make it easier) IF your place is one of these types: a college, a training place that gives out qualifications, a sixth form college that\u2019s not an academy, or if it\u2019s a learning center for folks under 25 with learning disabilities. \n\nBut heads up! The ESFA isn\u2019t the place to go if you\u2019re complaining about a job issue, like something's off with your contract if you\u2019re an apprentice or something. \n\nOh, if your problem was at an academy, then like, there\u2019s a different way to complain, so check that out too. \n\nOnce you realize you\u2019ve had issues, you gotta get it to the ESFA in 12 months or they probably won\u2019t care. You can either email or mail them your complaint.\n\nHit up the ESFA complaints crew at:\nCustomer.Complaints@education.gov.uk  \nOr send stuff to:\nESFA complaints team  \nEducation and Skills Funding Agency  \nCheylesmore House  \nQuinton Road  \nCoventry  \nCV1 2WT  \n\nThen wait for them to respond and tell you what\u2019s gonna happen next or whatever. \n\nAnd if you\u2019re still not happy with what they say?

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so like your tax credits can totally change based on what's going on in your family or work. You gotta tell HMRC if anything in your life changes, like, as soon as you can, to make sure you're getting the right money and stuff. If they pay you too much, they want it back and that's a bummer. And if your tax credits stop or something, that\u2019s it, you can't get them again, which kinda sucks, right? Oh, and if you need to, there's a version of this guide in Welsh, just so ya know.\n\n## Changes You Gotta Report  \nSo, you need to let HMRC know if:\n- You break up with someone, move in with a new partner, or get hitched.  \n- Some really sad stuff happens, like your partner or kid dies (but if you told them using the Tell Us Once service, you don\u2019t need to again).  \n- The kid stops going to childcare for like a month or more.  \n- Childcare costs drop by like \u00a310 or more a week, or you start getting help.  \n- Your kid leaves home \u2013 like they move out or go live somewhere else.  \n- Your kid gets in trouble and goes into custody.  \n- If they\u2019re older than 16 and stop school or training stuff.  \n- Your childcare place gets unregistered or whatever.  \n- And if your working hours drop below 30 hours a week, like, combined if you're part of a couple with kids.\n\nAlso, if you:\n- Go on vacation for 8 weeks or more.  \n- Leave the UK forever or if you don't have a right to stay.  \n- Start working less than 16 hours while you claim childcare help - unless it\u2019s a special case.  \n- Go on strike for more than 10 days straight.\n\nIf you get tax credits you shouldn\u2019t have, you gotta pay it back and might even get a fine or something.\n\n## Timing  \nYou have to tell them about these changes within a month, like, the sooner the better. If not, you might get fined up to \u00a3300 if you wait too long. And if there\u2019s wrong info, even up to \u00a33,000! Yikes! By the way, if you guessed your income when renewing your tax credits 'cause you're self-employed, you need to tell them your real income by January 31st.\n\n## Other Changes You Should Mention  \nJust keep them in the loop if you:\n- Change how much money you make (like, tell them if it changes by \u00a32,500 or more right away).\n- Start working 30 hours or more a week (if you\u2019re in a couple, it\u2019s combined, just saying).  \n- Have a new baby or take care of another kid.  \n- Start or stop claiming other benefits for yourself or someone in your family, or they change.  \n- Start getting a disability benefit \u2013 could help with tax credits, even if yours ended.  \n- Have changes with a disability that makes it hard to get a job.\n- You get proof that your kid is blind or whatever.  \n- Start tripping with registered childcare.  \n- Stop getting help for childcare costs.\n\nThese should be told within a month too, just so you get what you\u2019re entitled to and they usually can\u2019t backdate payments more than that.\n\nDon\u2019t sweat it if you or someone in the family switches from another disability benefit to stuff like Adult Disability Payment unless how much cash you get changes.\n\nAlso let them know if you change:  \n- Your bank stuff, up to a month before it happens.  \n- Your address \u2013 but wait until ya move.  \n- Childcare provider stuff.  \n- Your gender.  \n\n## Reporting It  \nYou can report changes through the [online thingy](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/gg/sign-in?continue=/tax-credits-service/renewals/service-router&accountType=individual&origin=PTA-taxcredits&_ga=2.26853556.842449638.1548667823-1568598937.1455889126) or the HMRC app. They even have videos on how to manage tax credits with that app, pretty neat!  \n\n## What You Can\u2019t Report Online  \nYou can't use the online service for stuff like the frequency of your payments or changes that aren\u2019t happening yet unless it\u2019s existing childcare costs.  \n\nYou can tell them by phone or post for those other changes.  \n\n## Before You Start  \nSo, make sure you have all the info about what changed, like job dates and PAYE numbers if you switched jobs.  \n\nYou gotta sign in for this service, and if you don\u2019t have an account, they\u2019ll make you create one. They might ask to check your ID with a photo, like a passport. \n\nSigning in sets up your personal tax account and you can check things out there. \n\n## Why Your Tax Credits Change  \nSo, your payments will stop if:\n- You or your partner apply for Universal Credit (even if it\u2019s not approved).  \n- You applied as single then start living with someone.  \n- You\u2019re living with someone and you break up.\n\nThey can drop or stop if:\n- Your income goes up by over \u00a32,500 - tell them right away to avoid overpayment.\n- You haven\u2019t renewed your claim.\n- If it shows you\u2019ve been overpaid or you\u2019re not eligible for the disability element anymore.\n- If your kid turns 16, 18, or 19, and you didn\u2019t tell HRMC that they\u2019re in school.\n- Your childcare costs drop.\n\nPayments can go up if:\n- Your income drops by more than \u00a32,500.\n- Your benefits drop or stop.\n- You start getting the disability element of tax credits.\n- If you have a baby.\n- Childcare costs spikes up. \n\nSo, yeah, that\u2019s basically it! Make sure you're on top of all the changes!",

And if you gotta report a teacher in England for being really bad at their job, that\u2019s where this service comes in. You can do that if you're either just a random person or maybe you're their boss or whatever.\n\nNow, listen up! You have to go through the school\u2019s complaint thing before you can go straight to reporting a teacher for serious misconduct. If you don\u2019t do that first, they might just ignore your report, and nobody wants that, am I right? \n\nBy the way, if you\u2019re in Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland, there are like different pages for that stuff. Check them out!\n\n### What\u2019s serious misconduct, anyway?\n\nSo, serious teacher misconduct is basically any stuff that would get a teacher kicked out and not able to teach again. This can be stuff like:\n- sexual misconduct, which is like, really bad things like assault or harassment or whatever,\n- violent behavior, which is just not cool,\n- totally failing to keep students safe, like come on,\n- being all about drugs or alcohol, which is not a teacher\u2019s thing,\n- fraud or being really dishonest,\n- being discriminatory or harassing someone,\n- or pushing some extreme political or religious stuff.\n\nOh, and you can report a teacher who quit or got fired too, that\u2019s still a thing.\n\n### What if it\u2019s not really that serious?\n\nIf you're thinking, \"eh, this isn\u2019t really serious teacher misconduct, just a complaint,\" then you should probably talk to the school or the governing body or even your local council. Like, there are ways to do that too.\n\n### Get ready before you do it\n\nBefore you start this whole reporting thing, you need to have some things ready:\n- Your contact info because you can\u2019t report a teacher and be all sneaky, they need to know who you are.\n- The full name and job title of the teacher you\u2019re turning in.\n\nAnd you should throw in any proof you have like reports you made, or messages you had with the school or police, or whatever.\n\n### What happens next?\n\nOnce you report, the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) will get back to you in about three days. They\u2019ll tell you if they\u2019re gonna look into it. If they do investigate, just a heads up \u2013 your name and details go to the teacher and their school. You might even have to talk at a hearing or something. \n\nThe whole thing could take forever, like several months, but they will keep you in the loop about what happens.\n\nIf your report is a no-go for investigation, they might still pass it along to the teacher, but don\u2019t worry, they won\u2019t reveal who you are.\n\n### Ready to report online?\n\nYou can save your info and then come back later if you wanna. \n\n[Start now!](https://refer-serious-misconduct.education.gov.uk/)\n\n### Want to report differently?\n\nYou can also do it by email if that's easier. There\u2019s two forms you fill out: one for the public and one for employers, and then you email it to TRA. Just send it to misconduct.teacher@education.gov.uk.\n\nIf you like, you could also send the form by snail mail, but like, use registered post so it gets there safe.\n\nSo yeah, just send it to:\nTeaching Regulation Agency  \nCheylesmore House  \n5 Quinton Road  \nCoventry  \nCV1 2WT  \n\nAnd that\u2019s about it.

Oh, and uh, there\u2019s a Welsh version of this guide too, if that\u2019s your thing.\n\n## Quick Trips Abroad\n\nIf you're just going away for a little bit, like for a vacation or something, you can still get Child Benefit. That\u2019s cool, right? Here\u2019s the scoop on how long you can still get your moolah based on why you leave:\n\n| Reason for leaving | How long you can get Child Benefit payments for  |\n|---|---|\n| Family member died | Up to 12 weeks  |\n| Medical stuff for you or your fam | Up to 12 weeks  |\n| Any other stuff like holidays | Up to 8 weeks  |\n\n### Moving Away for a Long While\n\nSo if you\u2019re packing your bags for a longer stay, like moving to some specific countries, you might still snag that Child Benefit money. Here\u2019s where it gets a bit, um, legal-y. Like if you\u2019ve moved to an EU country or anywhere that\u2019s been mentioned like Switzerland or whatever before 1 January 2021, you might still be eligible for Child Benefit, but only if you\u2019re:\n\n- Paying National Insurance in the UK still.\n- Got a job or doing your own thing (self-employed).\n\nAnd, oh! Also if you\u2019re getting some benefits like jobseeker's allowance or state pension or something, chances are you can still get it.\n\nIf you and your partner live in different countries, you might qualify for both, which is kinda neat, but usually, the country where the kid is living pays. If the other country pays more, then yeah, you could get extra from them.\n\n### Living in Certain Countries\n\nIf you\u2019re in one of these countries, you might still be able to get Child Benefit:\n- Barbados\n- Canada\n- New Zealand\n- Republic of Ireland\n- So many others, just ask the Child Benefit Office.\n\nYou should reach out to them to see if you can make a claim or something. \n\n## Crown Servants\n\nIf you\u2019re a Crown servant, that means, uh, you work for the royal family or whatever, you can still get Child Benefit if you\u2019re outside the UK, even if your kid isn\u2019t living with you. Before you went abroad, you had to have been in the UK or posted there. Pretty simple.\n\nMake sure to tell the Child Benefit Office ASAP when you\u2019re heading out for your new job or whatever.

If they\u2019re considered a worker, they usually get paid the National Minimum Wage. Internships have all sorts of names, like work placements or work experience \u2013 but honestly, those are just words and don\u2019t really mean much legally.\n\nInterns can be classified, like, in a few ways \u2013 either a worker, a volunteer, or an employee. So, if someone is doing actual paid work regularly, they might even qualify as an employee, which could mean they get more rights or whatever.\n\nNow, about rights to that National Minimum Wage thing \u2013 if you\u2019re labeled as a worker, then you're totally entitled to it. Employers can\u2019t just say it doesn\u2019t apply or throw you a piece of paper saying you\u2019re not a worker or something like that. They can\u2019t just avoid it, you know? \n\nAlso, if they promise you future work, that probably counts you as a worker too, meaning you\u2019d get paid.\n\nBut wait, there are exceptions. If you\u2019re a student doing like a mandatory internship that\u2019s less than a year long for college or whatever, you don\u2019t get the National Minimum Wage. Same thing goes for school kids doing work experience \u2013 they don\u2019t get paid either, they're just learning stuff. \n\nAnd if you\u2019re doing volunteer work, you don\u2019t get the minimum wage as long as you\u2019re helping out for a charity or something and you\u2019re just getting a few perks like travel or maybe lunch money, that's it.  \n\nOh! And if the internship is just you shadowing someone, like, literally not doing anything \u2013 just watching them work \u2013 then they don\u2019t have to pay you either, which is, like, a bummer, right?\n\nIf you're confused about all this pay and rights mumbo jumbo, you should reach out to the Acas helpline or whatever for advice.

But, to snag the National Living Wage, you have to be 21 or older, otherwise you just get the standard minimum wage if you\u2019re under 20. \n\n### Current Rates\n\nThese rates here are for both the National Living Wage (for folks 21 and up) and the National Minimum Wage (for those who are at least of school leaving age).

But, once you finish that first year, you\u2019ll go up to at least \u00a311.44 if you\u2019re still 21.\n\n### Previous Rates\n\nLike, here's a blast from the past! The rates from back in April 2021 to now were different, and they used to be like for older folks too:\n\n| Age Group           | April 2021 - March 2022 | \n|---------------------|------------------------|\n| 23 and over         | \u00a38.91     |\n| 21 to 22            | \u00a38.36     |\n| 18 to 20            | \u00a36.56     |\n| Under 18            | \u00a34.62     |\n| Apprentice          | \u00a34.30     |\n\nAnd there was even older stuff back before April 2021 where the living wage was only for 25 and older, which is kinda wild:\n\n| Age Group          | April 2019 - March 2020   | \n|---------------------|---------------------------|\n| 25 and over         | \u00a38.21     |\n| 21 to 24            | \u00a37.70     |\n| 18 to 20            | \u00a36.15     |\n| Under 18            | \u00a34.35     |\n| Apprentice          | \u00a33.90     |\n\n### Who Gets the Minimum Wage\n\nWanna know who gets this minimum wage?

But don\u2019t think you\u2019re free as a bird just yet, because you gotta do one of these things until you hit 18:\n\n- Go to a college or something full-time.\n- Get into an apprenticeship (whatever that means).\n- Work or volunteer for at least 20 hours a week while doing some part-time education. Like, imagine juggling that!\n\n## Scotland \n\nOkay, in Scotland things are a bit different. If you turn 16 in the time between March 1st and September 30th, you can bail after May 31st of that same year. But if your birthday is between October 1st and February's end, you can leave at the start of the Christmas break. Pretty specific, huh?\n\n## Wales \n\nWales, you\u2019re looking at leaving school on that same last Friday in June, just like England, but again, you gotta be 16 by the end of the school year's summer holidays.\n\n## Northern Ireland \n\nNow for Northern Ireland, if you\u2019re turning 16 during the school year (from September 1st to July 1st), you can skedaddle after June 30th. But if your birthday is after July 2nd and you turn 16 in August, then tough luck, you gotta stick around until the next year\u2019s June 30th. Boo!\n\n## Money for school stuff \n\nAlso, if you\u2019re in England and freaking out about costs, there's something called the 16 to 19 Bursary Fund where you can ask for cash to help out. In Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, there\u2019s this thing called Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) that helps with studying expenses too. So, like, it\u2019s not all doom and gloom!",

You\u2019ll have to go beg the office for them to send it back again or something.\n\n### How much moolah you can take home\n\nYou get to take all the money you owe at once, which is good, but there\u2019s a cap of \u00a3100 on each single payment. But wait! You can, like, collect more than one pay at the same time, just not over a hundred in one go, right?

So bring an original document, cause they won\u2019t take photocopies (what\u2019s that about?). Some things you can use are:\n  * A valid UK driving license, either paper or with a photo \n  * Your current passport (if you have one, duh)\n  * A current bill for gas or electricity or water or even your landline phone (make sure it\u2019s not older than 3 months though!)\n  * A council tax bill (super official)\n  * A tenancy agreement or something\n  * A letter from DWP or your council, but it has to be recent, okay? \n\n### If you want to pass the money collection to a buddy\n\nSo, if you want someone else to get your money for you, they gotta have:\n  * Your payment card or voucher (duh)\n  * Proof they\u2019re you (yeah that ID)\n  * And then their ID too (double checks, I guess)\n\n### What if someone can\u2019t do their own stuff? \n\nIf someone can\u2019t handle their own money, you can apply to be their appointee or something. Then you get a card to deal with their cash, but you also have to report if anything changes. \n\n### Losing your card or it\u2019s broken\n\nIf your card gets lost or messed up, like, just contact the Payment Exception Service, and they\u2019ll block it for you and send a new one. You\u2019ll also get a voucher via email or text so you don't miss out on cash.\n\n### Need help? \n\nIf this stuff is confusing or you got complaints, just reach out to the Payment Exception Service.\n\n### Contacting the Service\n\nSo if you wanna call these guys up, here\u2019s the deets:\nPayment Exception Service \nTelephone: 0800 015 2902 \nThey\u2019re around Monday to Friday from 8 am to 8 pm, then Saturday 8 am to 6 pm, Sunday from 10 am to 4 pm (like why do they have hours like this?

So, maybe a lawyer or a local council can do it too\u2014pretty interesting, huh? \n\n### What an Appointee Has to Do\n\nIf you're gonna be an appointee, you\u2019ve got some responsibilities. You\u2019ll need to do stuff like: \n  \n  - Sign that benefit claim form. Super important!  \n  - Let the benefit office know about any changes that might change how much money the claimant gets. Like if they get a job or something.  \n  - Use the money (that comes to you directly) wisely and in the best way for the claimant. \n  \n  - Also, tell the benefit office if you stop being the appointee, like if the claimant is suddenly doing just fine managing on their own. \n\nAnd if there\u2019s an overpayment like, too much money was given? You might get in trouble depending on the situation.  \n\n### How to Apply to Be an Appointee\n\nSo, to apply, who you call kinda depends on what benefit it is. Like for Attendance Allowance, you need to hit up the Attendance Allowance helpline at the Disability Service Centre. Fun times! For Disability Living Allowance, call that same helpline again.  \n  \nFor State Pension calls, don't forget the Pension Service! And for Personal Independence Payment (PIP), just call the PIP enquiry line. All other benefits? Just call Jobcentre Plus. \n\nAnd like, tax credits have a totally different process so be mindful of that too.  \n\n### Steps After Applying  \n\nSo here are the next things that happen once you\u2019ve applied:  \n  \n1. DWP will come to see the claimant to figure out if they need an appointee. \n2. Then they\u2019ll chat with you, asking questions to make sure you\u2019re good for this role.  \n3. During that chat thing, you\u2019ll fill out an application form together, called Form BF56.  \n4. If everything checks out, you\u2019ll get something called Form BF57, which means you\u2019re all set to be their appointee, until you get that, you\u2019re not really the appointee yet, okay?  \n\nOnce you\u2019re set up as an appointee, the DWP will keep checking in to see if it still makes sense for you to be handling the claimant's stuff. \n\n### Stopping as an Appointee\n\nIf you wanna stop being an appointee, just call DWP right away! The number should be on their letters.  \n\nThey can cancel your appointment if like, you aren\u2019t doing your job properly, or the claimant can manage on their own, or if you yourself become unable to handle it \u2013 just keep them in the loop!\n\nSo yeah, that's about it! Hope that makes sense or whatever!",

There might be some weird exceptions for tax credits and Child Benefit, though, so keep an eye on that. \n\nOh, and this info is also in Welsh, if you're into that. \n\nNow, about how often you get your cash:\n\n- So for Attendance Allowance, you usually get it every four weeks. \n- Carer\u2019s Allowance is either weekly ahead of time or every four weeks. \n- Child Benefit comes every four weeks too, but if you're a single parent or getting certain benefits, you might get it weekly. \n- If you\u2019re on Disability Living Allowance, you\u2019re also looking at every four weeks. \n- Employment and Support Allowance rolls in every two weeks.  \n- Same goes for Income Support and Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance, both every two weeks. \n- Maternity Allowance can be every two or four weeks, depending. \n- Pension Credit is like, every four weeks, and so is the Personal Independence Payment. \n- The State Pension? Yep, every four weeks too!  \n- Tax credits, like Working Tax Credit, can come every four weeks or weekly, just check your payment date so you\u2019re sure. \n- Universal Credit? That\u2019s a monthly thing.\n\nWhen you claim these benefits, they\u2019ll ask for your bank account details and stuff. If you don\u2019t have a bank or can\u2019t manage one, you gotta contact the office that pays your benefit for other options. \n\nAnd if for some reason you think you don\u2019t need some benefits they gave you, you can pay them back. You just gotta write to the department that sent you the money, and you\u2019ll find their address on any letters they sent you. Don\u2019t forget to toss in a check made out to them and include your National Insurance number and the details about what you\u2019re repaying, like when and how much. Easy peasy! \n\nBut, just a heads up, you can only pay back tax credits or Child Benefit if they overpaid you, which is a bit of a bummer.",

Access codes are 13 characters long and start with a V, for example, V-AB12-CD34-EF56. \n\nAccess codes can only be given over the phone, they cannot be sent by post. \n\nOnce confirmed, HMRC will then be able to update their tax records and discuss tax queries with the person helping you.\n\nIn some cases HMRC may also need either an original or certified copy of the LPA.

Like, if you have an accountant or even just a friend or your mom, they can deal with it for you. Once you authorize them, HMRC will send them all the letters, except for tax bills or refunds. In any other case, they'll keep sending stuff straight to you. So, yeah, make sure you choose wisely!  \n\nIf you just need help for a bit, uh, just call HMRC. You know, that government tax office? Anyway, your helper's gotta be there with you when you call 'cause they need to confirm they're legit or something before they start talking on your behalf.  \n\nOkay, if you want a paid agent, like a professional accountant or a tax adviser, that's cool too. But they gotta meet HMRC\u2019s standards\u2014whatever that means! You need to authorize them first before they can actually do anything for you, and they\u2019ll tell you how to do it or whatever. If you\u2019re one of those agents yourself, then you can go check out HMRC\u2019s stuff on how to get a client\u2019s permission.  \n\nSo, there\u2019s also this thing where you can ask a buddy or family member to help manage your tax online. This is called a \u2018trusted helper\u2019\u2014super cute name, right? They can check if you\u2019re paying the right Income Tax and update your personal tax account. But do they help with your Self Assessment or any tax credits? Nope, not in their job description! Just keep in mind, you're still responsible for your own taxes, so don't go slacking!  \n\nAnd if you're in a pickle, sick or can\u2019t speak English well, you can get an \u2018intermediary\u2019 to talk to HMRC for you. They can help you fill out forms and ask questions, but they can\u2019t go into your tax online stuff, just so you know. To authorize one of these people, you gotta write a letter to HMRC. Yeah, a letter!  \n\nJust make sure your letter has your name, address, tax reference like your Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR), and the name of the person you\u2019re authorizing. If you can\u2019t sign it, you gotta call HMRC or get help with that!  \n\nNow, if you wanna give someone power of attorney over your tax stuff, that's possible too. You can set up a lasting power of attorney (LPA). Depending on how you do it, they might be able to make tax decisions for you or help you decide things. If one day you can\u2019t make decisions anymore and you didn\u2019t set a power of attorney, someone can set up this deputyship thingy instead, which is kinda cool. Once registered, the person helping you has to notify HMRC to update their records. \n\nIf your helper needs to tell HMRC about the power of attorney, they can do it over the phone if certain conditions are met\u2014like the LPA being registered after 2016 in England or Wales. They also need an LPA online account to get an access code, which is pretty complicated and starts with a V. It\u2019s a whole thing, honestly!  \n\nIf they can\u2019t call, they can send either the original LPA or a certified copy through the mail. They need to know where to send it depending on whether it\u2019s tax credits or other tax things. If they're outside the UK, there's a different address\u2014fun times, I know.  \n\nIn the end, HMRC will return the copy plus send a reply back, and you only need to do all this again if something in your power of attorney changes! Yeah, taxes can be kinda wild!",

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so if you live in England and have a kid that's, like, between 9 months and 4 years old, you might get some free childcare. But how much you get is based on a few things, like your kid\u2019s age, if you\u2019re working (like a regular job or self-employed stuff), your income, and all that adulting immigration stuff.\n\nSo, if you\u2019ve already signed up for this, you can just log into your childcare account online, super easy. But listen up, if you're on certain benefits, you could also snag some free education and childcare for kids who are 2 years old under a different deal.\n\nAlso, just an FYI, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland all have their own things going on for childcare, so check those out too if you're in those areas.\n\n### Your Kid\u2019s Age Matters\nDepending on how old your kid is, the hours of free childcare changes a bit.\n\n- If they're 9 months to 2 years, you can get 15 hours a week.\n- For kids ages 3 to 4, it's 30 hours a week.\n\nBut, you won\u2019t be able to get any help if the kid doesn\u2019t live with you. Like, that\u2019s kind of important.\n\n### Foster Carers, Listen Close\nSo, if you\u2019re fostering a kid, you can still get this free childcare if you\u2019re working. You just have to be in paid work that\u2019s not fostering-related and make under \u00a3100,000. But you can\u2019t just apply online; gotta talk to your social worker instead. \n\n### If You Work\nYou typically get this free childcare if you or your partner are, like, working or about to start a job. Also, it covers people on sick leave or any parental leave. \n\n### Starting a Job or Going Back\nWhen you start a new job or return from leave makes a difference for when you can get this free stuff. Here\u2019s a quick n\u2019 dirty table:\n- Start date between May 1 and Sept 30? You start getting hours from September.\n- Start date between Oct 1 and Jan 31? From January.\n- Start date between Feb 1 and April 30? From April. \n\nEasy peasy, right? \n\n### Not Working? No Problem!\nEven if you\u2019re not working, you could still be eligible if your partner is working or you get certain benefits like Incapacity Benefit. Just ask around.\n\n### Income Stuff\nIn the next three months, you and your partner (if you have one) need to be making a certain amount:\n- \u00a32,380 before tax if you\u2019re over 21.\n- \u00a31,788 before tax if you're between 18 to 20.\n- \u00a31,331 before tax if you\u2019re under 18 or an apprentice. \n\nThis is like the minimum wage for about 16 hours a week or whatever. If your income is sort of unpredictable, that\u2019s fine too; you can average it out based on the tax year.\n\n### Self-Employed? You\u2019re Good\nEven if you're new to being self-employed, you can still qualify. \n\n### Multiple Jobs?\nIf you have more than one job, just add your earnings together to see if you meet the threshold. You could even use your self-employment income if that would get you in.\n\n### Income You Can Forget About\nSome money doesn\u2019t count toward your minimum earnings, like dividends, interest, or pensions. If you or your partner\u2019s adjusted income is over \u00a3100,000, you\u2019re out of luck, though.\n\n### Immigration Stuff\nLast but not least, you need to have a National Insurance number to even think about applying. And you or your partner need to have British or Irish citizenship, or some settled status. Super important, so check that out before you get too excited about free childcare!",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, listen up, if your kid turns 16 and isn't in school or training anymore, bam, your Child Benefit is gone as of August 31. But hey, if they\u2019re still in some good school or training that counts, you gotta let the HMRC know. \n\nYou\u2019ll actually get a letter in the last year of school asking what they\u2019re doing next. Super important! But only the person collecting the Child Benefit can tell HMRC what's up with your kid's school situation. \n\nOh, and if you wanna read this in Welsh, that\u2019s a thing too!  \n\n## What counts as approved education?  \n\nOkay, so for education to be legit, it\u2019s gotta be full-time, which means more than like 12 hours a week - you know, like actual classes and stuff. This includes A levels, T levels, NVQs up to level 3, and even some home-schooling if it\u2019s started at the right age. \n\nBut don\u2019t mess around with advanced courses like university stuff or, like, employer-paid training. If they got in on a course before 19, great, they\u2019re good to go.  \n\n### If your kid's sticking with approved education  \n\nFor kids aged 16-17, just tell HMRC online that they're staying in school. You need that Government Gateway ID and password, which is super easy to set up if you don\u2019t have it already. \n\nIf they\u2019re 18-20 and still studying, let HMRC know with the CH297 form. Just hop online!  \n\n### If they\u2019re leaving school  \n\nIf your kid's bailing on education, just tell HMRC using the CH459 form. Easy peasy.  \n\n## About approved training  \n\nIf they\u2019re doing training, it should be unpaid. In Wales, there\u2019s stuff like Foundation Apprenticeships, and in Scotland, they have a program called No One Left Behind or something. Just make sure it\u2019s not tied to any job contract or you\u2019re out.\n\n### Stay in approved training?  \n\nAgain, let HMRC know with that lovely CH297 form. \n\n### Leaving training?  \n\nUse the CH459 form to say they\u2019re out. Can't stress how simple this is!  \n\n## If they take a break  \n\nIf your kid switches schools or whatever, you might still get Child Benefit, so hit up HMRC about that.  \n\n## When education or training ends  \n\nWhen they finish school or training, payments will stop at the end of one of those months: February, May, August, or November, whichever comes first.  \n\n### Want more money? Apply for an extension  \n\nYou might score Child Benefit for an extra 20 weeks if they bail from school and sign up for a career service or join the armed forces.  \n\nSo, you can apply for this extension online or just contact HMRC directly. \n\nTo be eligible, they have to be 16 or 17, work less than 24 hours a week, and can't be on certain benefits like Income Support. Oh, and you gotta have been collecting Child Benefit right before they left school. Don\u2019t wait too long either\u2014apply within three months!  \n\n## Other ways to report changes  \n\nIf you need to tell someone about your kid\u2019s plans or changes, just hit up HMRC.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s it, folks!",

Also, if there\u2019s no safe way to walk there or if they can\u2019t walk 'cause of special needs or a mobility issue, then they could qualify too. \n\nBut hey, if none of that works out and you're kinda struggling with money, there's still a chance they could still get free transport! You should check with your local council for all that info on applying for this free ride thing. \n\nOh, and if your kid is 16 or older and still in school, you can also hit up your local council to see if they can help with transport for them too. That's important! \n\nNow, speaking of money, if your family's not doing too well financially, kids who don't qualify for free transport otherwise might still get help, but only if they get free school meals or if you're on maximum Working Tax Credit, whatever that is. \n\nYour kid is definitely gonna get a free bus ride if they're between 8-11 years old and go to the nearest school that\u2019s at least 2 miles away. Also, if they\u2019re between 11-16 and pick a school that\u2019s 2 to 6 miles away, as long as it\u2019s one of the three nearest schools, they\u2019re good! Then, there\u2019s also something about going to a school that\u2019s 2 to 15 miles away if you chose it for reasons of religion, but like, only under certain conditions or something. \n\nSo yeah, that's like the gist of it!

They know what to do, I guess.\n\n## Disability access fund\n\nNow, there\u2019s also this disability access fund thing where your kid's early years place could get over 900 bucks a year for their education. Again, your provider gets this money directly, it\u2019s not coming to you.\n\nYou can apply for this cash if your child gets Disability Living Allowance, which is some money for kids with disabilities. So, if your kid is getting that and also has any of these:\n\n- 15 hours free childcare for the 3s and 4s\n- 15 hours free for 2-year-olds who are disadvantaged\n- 15 hours free for younger kids if their parents are working (it\u2019s like 9 months to 2 years old)\n\nAnd just so you know, it doesn't matter if you don't use all of your childcare hours, you can still get the cash!\n\nWant to apply for that disability access fund? Just go chat with your childcare provider or your local council or whatever. Easy peasy!",

      "body": "For some employees you need to consider which earnings should be used in the average weekly earnings calculation before you can use the calculator.\n\n## Agency workers and casual (or short contract) employees\n\nThere are different rules for casual (or short contract) employees and agency workers.\n\n## Agency workers\n\nYou can treat agency workers as employees for PAYE tax and Class 1 National Insurance contributions (NICs). If you deduct PAYE tax and Class 1 NICs from the agency worker\u2019s earnings, or would do if they were high enough, then you must pay them Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) if they satisfy the qualifying conditions.\n\n## Agricultural workers\n\nThe Agricultural Wages Board in England was abolished on 1 October 2013.\n\nSince then agricultural workers in England who aren\u2019t covered by the terms and conditions of the Agricultural Wages Board have been eligible for statutory payments if they meet the appropriate qualifying conditions.\n\n## Casual and short contract employees\n\nA casual employee is usually someone who works for an employer, as and when they\u2019re needed on a series of short contracts of employment with that person. These casual workers may also be called short contract employees. If you have to deduct PAYE tax and Class 1 NICs from the worker\u2019s earnings, then you\u2019ll have to pay them SMP if they satisfy all the qualifying conditions.\n\n## Mariners\n\nMariners can get SMP if you have a place of business in the UK and they\u2019re on a home-trade ship.\n\n## NHS employees\n\nSome NHS employees whose contracts are split between Strategic Health Authorities and NHS trusts, as a result of NHS reorganisation, can choose to have all their earnings added together for working out Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) for SMP purposes.\n\nHowever, if an employee changes from one trust to another during the 26 weeks qualifying rule, the employee may not satisfy the continuous employment rule for SMP purposes.\n\nFor further advice Email: [doctorsanddentists@nhsemployers.org](mailto:doctorsanddentists@nhsemployers.org)\n\n## Supply teachers, seasonal workers or other sporadic employment\n\nSupply teachers, seasonal workers and other employees who work as and when you need them may not have worked for you in every week:\n\n  * from the latest start date for employment with you\n  * up to and including the Sunday of the Qualifying Week (QW)\n\n\n\nFor SMP in this instance, a week means Sunday to Saturday, as a week means different things in different contexts. Count part weeks as full weeks.\n\nIf they:\n\n  * worked for you in every week they\u2019ll satisfy the employment condition\n  * didn\u2019t work for you in every week you need to check why not\n\n\n\nThey can still get SMP if they didn\u2019t work if:\n\n  * they were on paid leave, or you didn\u2019t have work to offer them\n  * you offered them work and they turned it down but you must check the reason why they turned down the work\n\n\n\n## Directors\n\nCompanies are required to keep [records](https://www.gov.uk/running-a-limited-company/company-and-accounting-records) of shareholder votes and resolutions. Evidence of these will be requested to determine entitlement and recovery of SMP.\n\n### Companies incorporated before 1 October 2009\n\nThe previous standard articles, which apply in default, continue to apply. An ordinary resolution is required to determine director\u2019s remuneration. The method of calculating director\u2019s remuneration by an annual figure (after an ordinary resolution has been passed by shareholders) will apply to these companies. Any payments made in anticipation of the annual vote can\u2019t be taken into account for calculating AWE.\n\n### Companies incorporated after 1 October 2009\n\nThere are new regulations for companies incorporated after 1 October 2009. They provide new Articles of Association for these companies and will:\n\n  * default if other articles aren\u2019t adopted\n  * allow its directors to determine a director\u2019s remuneration\n\n\n\nDirectors can decide what remuneration to pay and when. There\u2019s no need for a resolution of the companies shareholders at its Annual General Meeting (AGM). In such cases payment of director\u2019s fees will be regarded as earnings for the purpose of entitlement to SMP on the date payment was made and the SMP calculator used in the normal way.\n\n#### Paid contractually\n\nIf the director is contractually paid a regular salary, their AWE are calculated like any other employee.\n\n#### Paid by a determination of the directors (not a formal vote)\n\nCalculate the AWE by adding together the monies paid and any other payments of earnings, but use the date monies were paid instead of the date of the shareholders\u2019 resolution at the AGM to determine the total earnings during the relevant period.\n\n#### Paid both contractually and by formal vote\n\nA director who is paid contractually may also be paid a bonus or fees by a formal vote. You must still calculate their AWE like any other employee, but you should only include the monies voted by formal vote if the date of the vote falls in the relevant period.\n\n#### Paid only by a formal vote\n\nIf the director is paid only by a formal vote calculate their AWE in the usual way, substituting the dates of the formal votes in place of the normal paydays.\n\nA formal vote usually takes place at the company\u2019s AGM and is agreed in the company minutes.\n\n#### Monies drawn in anticipation of a formal vote\n\nSome directors may regularly draw money from the business in anticipation of a formal vote. Don\u2019t include this money when working out the director\u2019s AWE, even if NICs were deducted at the time they were paid.\n\n## Employee has more than one job with you\n\nIf you add together all the employee\u2019s earnings to work out Class 1 NICs you must add them together to calculate the employee\u2019s AWE, and the employee can only get one amount of SMP. In this case, they should take the same time off from each job otherwise they\u2019ll lose some of their SMP because they\u2019re working for you.\n\nIf Class 1 NICs are worked out separately on the employee\u2019s earnings, then you must calculate their AWE separately, as the employee can get more than one amount of SMP.\n\nIn this case, they can choose to take different times off from each job without losing any SMP. This is because SMP entitlement is treated completely separately under each contract when earnings aren\u2019t added together to work out NICs.\n\n## Employee has more than one job\n\nIf a woman has more than one job, only one maternity certificate can be issued showing the expected date. They need to agree with one employer what other evidence will be accepted to confirm the date the baby is due.\n\nYour employee can either:\n\n  * show one employer the original MATB1 maternity certificate, which the employer can photocopy and then note the copy that the original has been seen and this is a true copy of the original which can then be given back to the employee for use by the other employer\n  * provide a letter which includes the pregnant woman\u2019s name and the date of confinement which must be stamped and signed by a doctor or midwife and if signed by a midwife, must have the midwife\u2019s PIN and expiry of registration date\n\n\n\n## Employee works abroad\n\nIf your employee works for you outside the UK from the latest start date for employment with you, and up to and including the Sunday of the QW they can get SMP.\n\nIf you weren\u2019t liable to pay Class 1 NICs throughout that period and they worked for you in the European Economic Area (EEA), they may still get SMP if you:\n\n  * were liable to pay Class 1 NICs on their earnings throughout that period, or would have been if their earnings had been high enough\n  * weren\u2019t liable to pay Class 1 NICs throughout that period and they worked for you in the EEA, but they worked for you in the UK in the QW, and you were liable to pay Class 1 NICs on their earnings for that week, or would have been if their earnings had been high enough\n\n\n  *[NICs]: National Insurance contributions\n  *[SMP]: Statutory Maternity Pay\n  *[AWE]: Average Weekly Earnings\n  *[QW]: Qualifying Week\n  *[AGM]: Annual General Meeting\n  *[EEA]: European Economic Area",

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so if you\u2019re figuring out how to do average weekly earnings (AWE) for some employees, there are things you gotta think about first before you start punching stuff into that calculator. \n\n### Agency workers and Casual Employees\n\nSo, there\u2019s like this whole different set of rules for casual workers or those who work short contracts and also for agency workers, just to keep it all straight. \n\n### Agency Workers\n\nBasically, you treat agency workers like they\u2019re your regular employees when it comes to PAYE tax stuff and that Class 1 National Insurance, right? If you\u2019re taking out the PAYE tax and Class 1 NICs from what they earn, then if they meet the rules, you gotta pay them Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP). \n\n### Agricultural Workers\n\nOh, and don\u2019t forget, the Agricultural Wages Board in England was, like, totally shut down back in 2013. So now, agricultural workers in England who are not under that board thing can get statutory payments if they pass the rules. \n\n### Casual and Short Contract Employees\n\nCasual employees are just those people who come in to work whenever there\u2019s a need like, short gigs or whatever. If you gotta take PAYE tax and NICs from their pay, you\u2019ll need to give them SMP too if they check off all the boxes for that. \n\n### Mariners\n\nLet\u2019s not forget about mariners. Those guys can also get SMP if your business is in the UK and they\u2019re working on a home-trade ship. Seems straightforward enough, yeah? \n\n### NHS Employees\n\nNow, for some NHS folks, if their contracts are kinda split and all after some NHS reorg, they can choose to add up all their earnings to figure out their AWE for SMP. But just a heads up, if they switch trusts during that 26 weeks, they might mess up their continuous employment thing for SMP.\n\nGot questions? Shoot an email to [doctorsanddentists@nhsemployers.org](mailto:doctorsanddentists@nhsemployers.org).\n\n### Supply Teachers and Seasonal Workers\n\nOkay, so for supply teachers and seasonal peeps or anyone who only works when you need them, they might not have been there every single week since their latest start date up till the Qualifying Week (QW) Sunday. Just to be clear, a week goes from Sunday to Saturday, because I guess there\u2019s different definitions of a week depending on where you\u2019re looking. Just count partial weeks as full weeks. \n\nIf they worked the whole time, then they\u2019re good for the employment condition. But if they missed some weeks, you gotta figure out why they weren\u2019t working. They can still get SMP if they weren\u2019t working due to paid leave or just no work available. If they turned down your offer, yeah, you gotta check why they did that too. \n\n### Directors\n\nAlright, and if we\u2019re talking about directors, companies need to keep records of votes and stuff. They want proof for getting SMP sorted out. \n\n#### For Companies Before 1 Oct 2009\n\nSo like, if your company started before this date, they still go by the old standard articles. You need a resolution to nail down what a director gets paid, and you can't count any pay before that resolution for AWE.\n\n#### For Companies After 1 Oct 2009\n\nNew companies after this date get new rules which let directors sort out their own pay, no resolution needed. But this means when they pay themselves, it counts as earnings for SMP when they actually pay it and you can just use the regular SMP calculator. \n\n#### Paid Regular Salary\n\nIf a director has a regular paycheck, you calc their AWE like anyone else. \n\n#### Paid by Directors\u2019 Decision\n\nIf they just decide on their pay kinda informally, you total their earnings based on when they were paid, not when the vote happened. \n\n#### Both Contractual and Formal Vote\n\nYou still total their AWE like a regular employee, but only add in money from votes that happen during that period. \n\n#### Only Formal Vote\n\nIf they only get paid through a formal vote, just use those vote dates to work out their AWE. By the way, votes usually go down at the AGM and they have to note that in the company records. \n\n#### Drawing Cash Before Vote\n\nSome directors grab cash expecting votes to happen, but don't count that when figuring AWE.\n\n### Employee with Multiple Jobs\n\nIf you\u2019ve got someone working multiple jobs, combine all their earnings for Class 1 NICs and AWE, but they\u2019ll only see one SMP payment. They need to take the same maternity leave from each job, or they could lose some SMP. If you calculate NICs separately, you work out AWE separately too, and they can take leave from each job at different times without losing SMP. \n\n### Employee with More than One Job\n\nIf, say, a woman has a few jobs, she only gets one maternity certificate that says when the baby is due. She needs to decide with one employer which other docs they\u2019ll accept as proof of the due date. They can either show the original MATB1 maternity certificate and have it copied, or give a letter signed by a doctor or midwife stamping the date. \n\n### Employee Works Abroad\n\nAnd for employees working overseas, if they\u2019re on your payroll working abroad and they meet the QW thing, they can also get SMP. If you didn\u2019t have to pay them Class 1 NICs during that time but they were in the EEA, they can still receive SMP if you\u2019ve been paying Class 1 NICs, or if you did pay them Class 1 NICs when they were working in the UK during the QW.",

      "poorly_written_article": "## Overview\n\nSo, if you\u2019re outta work or only working like less than 16 hours a week on average, you might be able to get this thing called Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) New Style. \n\nJSA New Style is, like, a payment you get every two weeks, and you can apply for it by itself or at the same time as Universal Credit (which is another thing that helps with money).\n\nNow, JSA New Style is based on contributions, meaning you can usually get it if you\u2019ve paid enough National Insurance contributions (that's like adult money you pay) in the last two years before the tax year you\u2019re applying for. Oh, and credits can count too, whatever that means.\n\nIf you\u2019re eligible, you can get JSA New Style for up to 182 days, which is like a bit over six months. Then your work coach will talk to you about what to do next, which is kinda like getting guidance or something.\n\nIf you qualify for both JSA New Style and Universal Credit, just know that JSA counts as income for Universal Credit, so that\u2019s a thing too.\n\n## Why Should I Apply for JSA New Style?\n\nDon\u2019t stress, \u2018cause your savings and capital (like, money and things you own, also your partner's stuff too) don't get checked when you apply for JSA New Style. But hey, your earnings or any pension payments can affect how much money you can actually get.\n\nWhile you\u2019re getting JSA New Style, you get this credit statement thing, which counts towards your State Pension or whatever other benefits are in your future. It\u2019s like a regular payment every two weeks, so mark your calendars!\n\nHere\u2019s a quick table showing what you may apply for, based on your situation:\n\nYour Situation | JSA New Style | Universal Credit  \n---|---|---  \nYou're not working or work under 16 hours weekly and need help between jobs.  \nYou\u2019ve paid or got credited with National Insurance contributions for like the last 2-3 years.\n| You can apply for JSA New Style \u2014 even if your partner works or you guys have savings over \u00a316,000. | You can apply for Universal Credit if you have kids or housing costs.\n\nYou can also apply for Universal Credit if you have \u00a316,000 or less in savings.  \nYour partner's income counts 'cause you need to apply for Universal Credit as a couple.  \nAny JSA you get will count as income, but you might still get Universal Credit.  \nOkay, that's a lot, right? \n\nYou're out of work or working under 16 hours and haven't paid or received any contributions for two to three years.\n|  You probably can't get JSA New Style since you haven't paid any contributions.\n|  You can apply for Universal Credit again if you have kids or housing costs.\n\nAnd also, if you have \u00a316,000 or less savings, then go for it! \nYour partner\u2019s income matters again when applying as a couple.  \n\nAnd so it goes on with others situations that don\u2019t change that much.  \n\n### Qualification Stuff\n\nTo qualify for JSA New Style, usually, you need to have worked for the last 2-3 years and made (or got credited with) National Insurance contributions. \n\nAlso, you gotta be outta work or working less than 16 hours a week on average. And like, you\u2019ve gotta be looking for work too, like, actively searching or something.\n\nIf you\u2019re sick or disabled and can\u2019t work, then sorry, you can\u2019t get JSA New Style, but you might be able to get this Employment and Support Allowance \u2014 New Style, which I guess helps too? \n\n## How to Apply\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to apply, you\u2019ll need:\n\n- Your National Insurance number (don\u2019t lose this one, it\u2019s important!)\n- Bank or building society account details (or a family member/friend\u2019s info if you trust them)\n- Info about your work from the last six months, like who you worked for and when.\n- A letter about any private pension you might have too. \n\n### Apply Online\n\nBut like, you can\u2019t apply online if you\u2019re under 18 or something.  \n[Apply for JSA New Style Here](https://www.apply-for-new-style-jsa.dwp.gov.uk/?lang=cy)\n\n### If You Can't Apply Online or Need Other Formats\n\nContact the Jobcentre if you\u2019re:\n- 16 or 17 years old\n- Need help to apply\n- Want stuff in another format, like Braille or audio or whatever. \n\n### If You\u2019re in Northern Ireland\n\nIf you can\u2019t apply online or need alternative formats, contact the Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance Processing Centre over there. \n\n## After You Apply\n\nIf you gave your mobile number or email when applying, you should get a text or email saying your application went through. \n\nThen the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will reach out to you within like 14 days after your application. Either you\u2019ll:\n- Get invited for an interview at your local Jobcentre \n- Receive a letter explaining why you\u2019re not eligible for JSA \n\nYou don\u2019t have to contact the DWP unless two weeks pass and you haven\u2019t heard anything.\n\n## Your JSA Interview\n\nIf you get invited for an interview, make sure to actually go, it\u2019s like a must. They\u2019ll ask you some questions about yourself, and you\u2019ll agree on steps to look for work, which is pretty standard. \n\nYou'll need to bring:\n- One proof of photo ID\n- One proof of your address\n- One further proof of your identity \n\nIf you have a P45 from your employer, bring that too, it serves as proof. \n\n### Examples of Photo ID\n- Valid passport \n- Driving license \n- Biometrics residence permit or visa \n- Naturalization certificate \n- Permanent residence permit \n\n### Proof of Address Examples\nYou could use:\n- Pay slip or pension statement dated in the last 6 months\n- Utility bill from the last 6 months\n- Council tax bill also from the last 6 months\n- Student loan documents\n\n### Extra Identity Proof\nCould include:\n- Your P60\n- Savings book\n- Personal checkbook\n- Debit, credit, or store card with statement confirming card details.\n\nYou can use utility bills for address proof as long as they\u2019re from different providers.  \n\n### Help at Your Interview\nYou can bring someone with you to your JSA interview if you want!\n\nContact your Jobcentre before the interview if you need help due to a disability or health condition.  \nLike, if you\u2019re deaf and need a sign language interpreter or anything.  \n\n### Sign the Agreement to Search for Work (This Commitment Thing)\nDuring the JSA interview, you\u2019ll have to sign something agreeing on what you\u2019re gonna do to search for work. \n\nThis is called the \u201cClaimant Commitment.\u201d  \n\nYou and your work coach will decide what goes into it, like:\n- What you\u2019ll do to look for jobs \u2014 like register with agencies or write a CV.\n- How many hours you gotta spend looking for work every week.\n\nWhat you agree to do depends on:\n- Your health\n- Your home responsibilities\n- How much help you need getting back to work or increasing your earnings.\n\n**Note:** Your JSA can be reduced or stopped if you don\u2019t do what you promised in your Claimant Commitment without a good reason, which is kinda serious!  \n\n## If You Don\u2019t Agree with a Decision\n\nYou can challenge a decision on your application. They call this asking for a mandatory reconsideration. \n\nSo that\u2019s the deal about that, good luck sorting your stuff out!",

      "body": "If you or your organisation offer work experience, including \u2018placements\u2019 and internships, you need to consider if the person who will work for you is entitled to the National Minimum Wage (NMW) or National Living Wage (NLW). Both are referred to here as minimum wage.\n\nIt is your responsibility to decide whether the person is a worker for minimum wage purposes and, if they are, whether an exemption applies to them.\n\nFailure to pay the minimum wage to someone who is entitled to it is against the law. If an unpaid person claims that they are owed minimum wage arrears, you must prove that they are not a worker or that no arrears are owed. Someone\u2019s entitlement to the minimum wage depends on the contractual relationship with their employer, not their job title.\n\n## What is work experience\n\nThe term \u2018work experience\u2019 generally refers to a specified period of time that a person spends with your business, during which they have an opportunity to learn directly about working life and the working environment.\n\nSome work experience positions offer people the chance to try their hand at particular tasks, others simply provide an opportunity to watch and learn. The nature, length and arrangements for work experience vary greatly. Someone\u2019s entitlement to the minimum wage will depend on whether the work experience offered makes the individual a worker for minimum wage purposes.\n\n## What counts as an internship\n\nWork experience can be called a \u2018placement\u2019 or an \u2018internship\u2019. Internships are sometimes understood to be positions requiring a higher level of qualification than other forms of work experience, and are associated with gaining experience for a professional career. However, the term \u2018intern\u2019 has no legal status under minimum wage law. Entitlement to the minimum wage does not depend on what someone is called, the type of work they do, how the work is described (such as \u2018unpaid\u2019 or \u2018expenses only\u2019) or the profession or sector they work in. What matters is whether the agreement or arrangement they have with you makes them a worker for minimum wage purposes. [See \u2018Who gets the minimum wage\u2019.](https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage/who-gets-the-minimum-wage)\n\nSome forms of work experience, including placements and internships, may be referred to as \u2018unpaid work\u2019 or \u2018expenses only\u2019, where someone gives their services free of charge in order to develop or maintain their skills. Organisations offering such positions should check if the person is a [volunteer](https://www.gov.uk/volunteering) for minimum wage purposes or if an exemption applies. If the person is not a genuine volunteer and is not exempt, then you must pay them at least the minimum wage.\n\n## Exemptions in the legislation relevant to work experience\n\nSome people are not entitled to the minimum wage because there is a specific exemption in the rules.\n\nThe exemptions relevant to work experience are:\n\n  * students working as a required part of a UK-based further or higher education course don\u2019t qualify for the minimum wage if their placement with you or your organisation does not exceed 1 year. The exemption does not apply to students performing work that is not related to their course, such as to help finance their studies or during a gap year\n  * people undertaking work experience for you who are of compulsory school age are not entitled to the minimum wage. If someone is above compulsory school age but has stayed on in full or part-time education, they are entitled to the minimum wage unless they are undertaking a work placement with you as a required part of their studies\n  * participants in government schemes or programmes to provide training, work experience or temporary work, or to help in seeking or obtaining work\n  * participants in EU Lifelong Learning Programmes (Leonardo da Vinci, European Community Youth in Action, Erasmus or Comenius)\n  * voluntary workers in your organisation are exempt from the minimum wage if both the following apply: \n    * you are a charity, voluntary organisation, associated fund-raising body or statutory body\n    * you give them no monetary payments and only limited and specified expenses and benefits\n\n\n\nNot every worker who works for a charity, voluntary organisation, associated fund-raising body or statutory body is automatically a voluntary worker.\n\n## Arrangements which don\u2019t qualify for the minimum wage\n\nSomeone who is doing a placement that does not involve any work being performed, such as work shadowing, will not come within the National Minimum Wage legislation. They are only observing and are not performing work.\n\nPeople who are doing a placement on a volunteer basis are not workers for minimum wage purposes.\n\n## Volunteers\n\nIn general a volunteer is someone who:\n\n  * has an arrangement with you or your organisation which does not entitle them to a financial reward or benefit in kind for work they perform under the arrangement\n  * does not have to turn up for work if they don\u2019t want to (even if you or their colleagues expect them to or they generally work to a regular pattern)\n  * cannot be dismissed, sued for breach of contract or have payment or reward withheld if they fail to do the work or perform the services they were providing\n\n\n\nThe intention behind the unpaid activity (whether to benefit the environment, other groups, or the individual personally) is irrelevant. Someone may volunteer to do work to gain experience or in the hope that they will get a good reference. However, a promise to provide a contract or further work that will be paid may make the individual a worker for minimum wage purposes and thereby entitle them to the minimum wage.\n\nVolunteers may be paid back reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Payment of such expenses will not make them a worker for minimum wage purposes.\n\nCalling an unpaid worker \u2018unpaid\u2019 or \u2018a volunteer\u2019, even if the individual agrees to this, does not prevent them from qualifying for the minimum wage if they are entitled.\n\n## What to consider when designing work experience placements\n\n### Recruitment advertising\n\nBefore advertising a vacancy on an \u2018unpaid\u2019 or \u2018expenses only\u2019 basis, you should check whether the person that you are planning to recruit will be classed as a worker for minimum wage purposes. [See \u2018Who gets the minimum wage\u2019.](https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage/who-gets-the-minimum-wage)\n\nAdverts which suggest illegal unpaid positions inform HM Revenue and Customs\u2019 risk assessment process, and employers who are considered to be \u2018at risk\u2019 of not paying the minimum wage may be targeted for further investigation.\n\n### Employment contracts and other written agreements\n\nIf you take someone on a work shadowing or on a volunteer basis, it is recommended that you agree elements of the arrangement in writing, such as learning objectives, and tailor their activities to these learning objectives. Documenting objectives for the work experience and recording that you will pay back \u2018out of pocket\u2019 expenses will not, in itself, amount to an employment contract or a contract to personally perform work or services which entitles the individual to the minimum wage.\n\nSimply stating in a written agreement that a person is not a worker or that they are a volunteer does not mean that they are so for the purposes of NMW legislation. A court or tribunal would look at the reality of the arrangements made with the individual to decide if they are entitled to the minimum wage.\n\nStating in documents that the minimum wage does not apply will not limit your liability to pay the minimum wage when it is due. National Minimum Wage legislation ensures an employer cannot avoid paying minimum wage in this way (even if the person concerned agrees to this).\n\n### Record keeping and health and safety\n\nIf you take someone on as a worker, the usual rules on record keeping apply.\n\nIf you take someone on a work shadowing or volunteer basis, we strongly recommend that you document the arrangement that you have made with the person, and/or keep a record of any oral agreements in setting up the arrangements and any subsequent changes. In particular, if someone claims that they owed minimum wage arrears, you must demonstrate that they are not a worker for minimum wage purposes or that no arrears are owed.\n\nThe government encourages people who accept work experience placements or internships to keep records of what they agreed with their employer. This information may be used as evidence if their entitlement to the minimum wage is considered at a future date, such as by a tribunal or [HM Revenue and Customs](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs). Note the promise of a contract or future job may amount to a benefit in kind which makes the person a worker for minimum wage purposes.\n\nMaking someone doing work experience comply with a legal requirement, such as health and safety, is unlikely on its own to result in the person being classed as a worker and entitled to the minimum wage.\n\n## Work experience - examples\n\nThese are for illustrative purposes only. Ultimately only a court or tribunal can decide if someone is entitled to the minimum wage in a given set of circumstances.\n\n### Examples of workers who are entitled to the minimum wage\n\n#### Example 1: internship with an oral agreement\n\nLucas takes up an internship at a newspaper business. He agrees orally with the editor that he will work personally for 4 days a week from 9am to 5pm and will undertake research activities as directed. He receives some payment for working the agreed hours.\n\nLucas has made an oral contract with the editor and should be paid at least the minimum wage.\n\nA contract can be oral or implied as well as written.\n\n#### Example 2: \u2018unpaid intern\u2019 with a promise of paid work\n\nAmanda applies for a position at a record company. She is told that for 3 months she will be paid \u2018expenses only\u2019 and is referred to as an \u2018unpaid intern\u2019. However, as part of her agreement with the company, it is promised that at the end of her \u2018internship\u2019 she will be taken \u2018on the books\u2019 and paid above the minimum wage.\n\nAmanda should be paid at least the minimum wage for the whole time she spends at the record company.\n\nWhether someone is a worker does not depend on what job title they are given. For example, calling someone an \u2018unpaid intern\u2019 or \u2018volunteer\u2019 does not prevent them from qualifying for the minimum wage if they are really a worker. The promise of paid work is a form of reward for work undertaken.\n\n#### Example 3: work experience with a financial reward\n\nDavid successfully applies for a work experience position in a small graphic design company, after seeing an advert offering \u00a350 \u2018travel expenses\u2019 for each week. He receives these \u2018travel expenses\u2019 despite walking to work.\n\nDavid should be paid at least the minimum wage.\n\nPaying a financial reward which is more than paying back genuine \u2018out-of-pocket\u2019 expenses is evidence that David is a worker for minimum wage purposes.\n\n#### Example 4: signed agreement to \u2018unpaid\u2019 work with a reward\n\nBen takes up an acting role in a short film. He signs a form agreeing to work unpaid. However he is promised a small percentage of any future profits, a DVD copy of the film and tickets to the company\u2019s releases for the rest of the year, but no salary.\n\nBen should be paid at least the minimum wage.\n\nAn individual cannot sign away their rights to the minimum wage. Entitlement to the minimum wage depends on whether they are a worker. Ben isn\u2019t a volunteer because he will get a reward for the work he does - the fact that no cash changes hands is irrelevant as benefits in kind that have a monetary value count as a reward.\n\n### Examples of workers who are not entitled to the minimum wage\n\nThese workers are covered by a specific exemption in National Minimum Wage legislation.\n\n#### Example 5: work experience of less than a year as part of a course\n\nKaterina is studying at teacher training college to become a primary school teacher. She spends 2 periods of 8 weeks working in local primary schools as part of her course.\n\nKaterina does not need to be paid the minimum wage because the work is a required part of her course and the placement at the primary school does not exceed 1 year.\n\nStudents doing work experience as a required part of a UK-based further or higher education course are workers who are exempt from the minimum wage, as long as the total time of their placement does not exceed 1 year.\n\nHowever, in the evenings, Katerina works in a local restaurant to fund her studies. Katerina should be paid at least the minimum wage for her work in the restaurant. The exemption does not cover students doing work that is not part of their course.\n\n#### Example 6: voluntary worker at a charity with a contract for paid expenses\n\nDonna takes up an internship as a charity\u2019s events organiser. She has a contract in which she has agreed to organise certain events for the charity and attend on particular days and times \u2013 she is not paid, but travel and lunch expenses are paid back.\n\nDonna does not need to be paid the minimum wage because she is a voluntary worker.\n\nVoluntary workers are workers who are specifically exempt from the minimum wage under National Minimum Wage legislation. To be exempt, they must work for a charity, voluntary organisation, associated fund raising body or statutory body and receive no monetary payments and only limited and specified expenses and benefits.\n\n### Examples of individuals who are not workers and are therefore not entitled to the minimum wage\n\n#### Example 7: work shadowing\n\nSayeed, a university student, arranges 2 weeks\u2019 work shadowing at a local company. This is unrelated to his studies. At the company, Sayeed shadows team members in different parts of the organisation and learns about the company. His activities are limited to observing, listening and questioning. He does not receive any payments, but can claim travel expenses.\n\nSayeed does not need to be paid the minimum wage because he is not a worker for minimum wage purposes.\n\nIndividuals taking part in work shadowing are not performing work.\n\n#### Example 8: volunteering with no contract\n\nRyan volunteers at a museum. He has no contract with the museum. He has a regular pattern of working on Tuesdays and Thursdays 9am to 6pm. He is not obliged to turn up for work, but is asked to let the museum\u2019s manager know if he is unable to come on his usual days. He is welcomed back after periods away. His role usually involves administrative tasks (answering the phones and taking notes of meetings in a set format), but can change from day to day, with details set out by a manager each morning. He is unpaid but receives travel and lunch expenses for the days he works.\n\nRyan does not need to be paid the minimum wage as he is a volunteer.\n\nOthers expecting you to turn up or generally working a regular pattern does not necessarily indicate you are a worker, unless the employer can require you to work or impose sanctions for failure to do work. An individual can be a volunteer even if they are working under the supervision or control of a manager or having to meet specific standards or guidelines.\n  *[NMW]: National Minimum Wage\n  *[NLW]: National Living Wage",

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so if you or your company are giving out work experience stuff, like internships or placements, you need to think about if that person should get paid the National Minimum Wage (NMW) or National Living Wage (NLW). They usually lump those together and just call it minimum wage (which is kinda funny, right?).\n\nIt\u2019s up to you to figure out if that person counts as a worker for minimum wage. Like, if they are, you gotta check if they can get exempted or not, whatever that means.\n\nNot paying minimum wage when someone should get it? Totally illegal. If someone who\u2019s not getting paid says they should, you gotta prove they\u2019re not really a worker or that there\u2019s no money owed. It\u2019s not about what they do or their title, but how they and you are set up contractually or whatever.\n\nSo, what\u2019s work experience anyway? Well, it\u2019s usually this set time where a person hangs out with your company and learns about the job and all that good stuff. Sometimes they get to do tasks, and sometimes they just watch. Depends on the gig and how long it is. If you\u2019re offering work experience, you gotta check if it makes them a worker for minimum wage rules.\n\nInternships? Oh, they can sound fancy. It\u2019s pretty much just another name for work experience - sometimes people think they gotta have more qualifications or whatever because it\u2019s for their career. But the term \u2018intern\u2019 doesn\u2019t actually mean anything legally for minimum wage. So, it doesn\u2019t matter what you call them or how much you're paying, it just matters if they have an agreement with you that makes them a worker.\n\nSometimes they say they\u2019re doing \u2018unpaid\u2019 work or just get their expenses covered and are doing it to gain skills. You gotta see if they\u2019re really a volunteer for minimum wage reasons or if some exemptions apply. If they aren\u2019t a true volunteer and don\u2019t have any exemptions, then yep, you gotta pay them.\n\nNow, about exemptions. There are some people who just don\u2019t get minimum wage because there are rules that allow for it. \n\nFor example:\n- Students who are doing work as part of their UK education course don\u2019t earn minimum wage as long as the work placement isn\u2019t over a year. But it\u2019s gotta relate to their course, not just something they do to make money or a gap-year gig.\n- If they\u2019re still in school but over the age and staying in education, they get paid unless it\u2019s mandatory for their schooling.\n- People in government work programs or training stuff usually don\u2019t get it either.\n- Some people involved in EU learning programs also get the pass.\n- Volunteers at charities are exempt only if they don\u2019t get money and only get some help with expenses.\n\nBut just because someone works at a charity doesn\u2019t automatically mean they\u2019re a volunteer, so watch out for that!\n\nNow let\u2019s talk about placements that don\u2019t count for minimum wage. If they\u2019re just watching, like work shadowing, they don\u2019t count in the minimum wage world since they\u2019re not doing any real work. Also, adding in volunteer stuff means they shouldn't be counted as a worker for money reasons either.\n\nSo, what\u2019s a volunteer? Basically, if you\u2019ve got someone who has an understanding with you that they\u2019re not getting paid for what they do, and they don\u2019t have to show up if they don\u2019t want to, they\u2019re a volunteer. Like if they don\u2019t get fired or sued if they skip out, that\u2019s them. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if they are helping out for fun or because they want a good reference.\n\nIf they spend money on stuff while volunteering, you can pay them back. But that alone won\u2019t make them a worker.\n\nJust because you call someone \u2018unpaid\u2019 or \u2018a volunteer\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t get minimum wage if they deserve it.\n\nOkay, when you\u2019re making work experience placements, think about where you advertise. If you wanna put up a vacancy that\u2019s unpaid or just covering expenses, check first to see if that person you\u2019re bringing in is gonna be seen as a worker (it\u2019s a big deal, so double-check that).\n\nThen, if you take someone on, it\u2019s recommended to write down the stuff you\u2019re agreeing on, like what they\u2019ll learn. And saying \u201cyou\u2019re not a worker\u201d in writing won\u2019t make it true for the laws.\n\nYou should also keep records about what you\u2019ve agreed. If someone says they should get paid down the line, you\u2019ll need proof they\u2019re not a worker to avoid falling into trouble for unpaid wages.\n\nNow, look at some examples! These are just to show how it works, cause only a court can really decide for sure based on the situation.\n\nFirst example - Lucas is interning at a newspaper, and he made an oral deal to work certain hours. He\u2019s getting paid for those hours, so he\u2019s entitled to minimum wage for sure.\n\nThen there\u2019s Amanda, who thinks she\u2019s an unpaid intern. But she\u2019s promised paid work at the end of it, so she\u2019s entitled to minimum wage during her whole time there.\n\nDavid got a work experience deal but thought he was just getting travel cash. Since it\u2019s more than just expenses, he counts as a worker.\n\nBut Ben, he worked on a film unpaid but got some great benefits later on. He should be getting minimum wage too.\n\nNow, who doesn\u2019t get the min wage? Katerina, who\u2019s studying and doing required parts of her course, doesn\u2019t ever need to be paid since it\u2019s all 100% in the course.\n\nThen we\u2019ve got Donna, who\u2019s organizing events for a charity and isn\u2019t paid but gets some of her expenses covered. Totally exempt from minimum wage.\n\nAnd oh boy, Sayeed just watched at a company for two weeks, he doesn\u2019t get paid because that\u2019s not real work. \n\nLastly, Ryan at the museum is also just volunteering. He\u2019s not a worker because he doesn\u2019t have a contract and his time isn\u2019t required to be there.\n\nSo that\u2019s a lot to take in, right? But like, just remember to keep things clear and check who gets what when it comes to pay. You really don\u2019t wanna mess that up!",

      "body": "## Maternity Leave policy and procedure\n\nFebruary 2017\n\nPolicy review date: 28/02/2020\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (the Agency) aims to provide full support to pregnant employees at this important time. The following paragraphs explain the Agency\u2019s arrangements for maternity leave and pay as well as outlining the current statutory rights for you. Where you are eligible under both the statutory and the Agency schemes, you may choose the option which is more beneficial to you. However, if you have entitlement to the Agency provisions as well as statutory rights, you can only exercise one option, not both.\n\nThis policy should be read in line with the Agency\u2019s Shared Parental Leave (SPL) policy if you wish to share your parental leave. Where a woman and her partner meet the qualifying conditions for SPL, the woman can end her maternity leave and pay, or commit to ending it at a future date and share the untaken balance of maternity leave and pay as SPL and pay. Please refer to the SPL policy for further information.\n\n### Scope\n\nThis policy applies to all pregnant agency employees.\n\nThis policy does not apply to contractors or agency workers who should refer to the maternity leave entitlements set out by their employer. Staff on secondment from other organisations will need to refer to their own maternity leave and pay arrangements.\n\n### Notifying the agency\n\nThe Agency has a duty to provide details of maternity leave entitlement to you as soon as you know you are pregnant. Therefore, at least 15 weeks before your expected week of childbirth (EWC), you should notify your line manager and HR in writing of the following:\n\n  * the expected date of childbirth\n\n  * the intended date of leaving work\n\n  * whether or not you intend to return to work\n\n  * confirm in due course, the actual date of childbirth and, if you intend to return to work before the date when your maternity leave will end, give as much notice as possible, and not less than 28 days. If you subsequently change your mind, you must give your manager at least 28 days\u2019 notice of this change.\n\n\n\n\n### Health and safety whilst pregnant\n\nThe agency has a duty to take care of the health and safety of all employees. They are also required to carry out a risk assessment (Appendix A) to assess the workplace risks to women who are pregnant, have recently given birth or are breastfeeding. This is especially important where the work is of a kind that could involve a risk of harm or danger to your health and safety or the health and safety of your baby. If applicable, the agency will provide you with information as to any risks identified in the risk assessment. If the risk assessment reveals that you would be exposed to health hazards in carrying out your normal job duties, the agency will take such steps as are reasonably necessary to avoid those risks, such as altering your working conditions. In exceptional circumstances some cases, this may mean offering you suitable alternative work (if available) on terms and conditions that are not substantially less favourable.\n\nIf all other options have been exhausted and in exceptional circumstances, if it is not possible for the agency to alter your conditions to remove the risks to your health and there is no suitable alternative work available to offer you on a temporary basis, the agency may suspend you from work on maternity grounds until such time as there are no longer any risks to your health. This may be for the remainder of your pregnancy until the commencement of your maternity leave. If you are suspended in these circumstances, your employment will continue during the period of the suspension and it does not in any way affect your statutory or contractual employment and maternity rights. You will continue to be entitled to your normal salary and contractual benefits during the period of your suspension, unless you have unreasonably refused an offer of suitable alternative employment.\n\n### Part one \u2013 Contractual Entitlement\n\n#### 1\\. Paid maternity leave\n\nYou will be allowed 26 weeks maternity leave on full pay and a subsequent 13 weeks paid at Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) (See Statutory Maternity Pay below for further information) for the period of continuous absence before and after childbirth, provided you:\n\n  * State that you intend to return to work in the Agency after your maternity leave, and agree to repay any contractual payment made during that period if you fail to the agency for at least 1 month. You should complete the application form in Appendix B. If you fail to do so, paid maternity leave will not be allowed; and\n\n  * You are in paid service at the time your maternity leave begins and have completed at least 1 years\u2019 service within the Civil Service which needs to be continuous (staff in receipt of sick pay at pension rate are not regarded as being in paid service).\n\n\n\n\nIf ineligible for paid maternity leave, you will still have a statutory right to 52 weeks unpaid leave, and may qualify for SMP or maternity allowance. See also the Special Leave guidance.\n\nThe period of paid maternity leave will not be regarded as sick leave. The payments received will count for pension purposes in the same way as normal salary.\n\n  1. Repayment of paid maternity leave\n\n\n\nThe terms of the relevant undertaking (see Appendix B) require you to return to work within 52 weeks from the start of your maternity leave period or at the end of an agreed career break for at least 1 month. Failing to return for the minimum period will mean that the salary paid must be refunded to the Agency. Exceptionally, a refund may be deferred if your return to work is delayed by certified sickness or by authorised special leave without pay, provided you eventually resume duty and complete the equivalent of a calendar month\u2019s paid service.\n\n### Part two \u2013 Statutory Entitlement\n\n#### 1\\. Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP)\n\nPregnant women employees are entitled to:\n\n  * 26 weeks ordinary maternity leave (OML), followed by a further\n\n  * 26 weeks additional maternity leave (AML) regardless of how long they have worked in the Civil Service.\n\n\n\n\nThe first 39 weeks is normally paid leave, either in the form of Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP), subject to length of service, or Maternity Allowance which is paid by Department of Work and Pensions offices.\n\n#### 2\\. SMP Entitlement\n\nYou will be entitled to SMP if you:-\n\n  * Have been continuously employed in the Civil Service for at least 26 weeks by the 15th week before the expected week of childbirth (the qualifying week) and have been employed at least one day into the qualifying week; and\n\n  * Have average gross earnings of not less than the lower earnings limit for National Insurance contributions applicable in the qualifying week (above average earnings are calculated by adding your gross earnings for the last 8 weeks prior to the qualifying week, multiplying by 6 and dividing by 52); and\n\n  * Are still pregnant at the 11th week before the expected week of childbirth or have given birth by that time; and\n\n  * Have stopped work to have a baby (whether or not you intend to return to work after childbirth); and\n\n  * Inform the Agency in writing (see Appendix B) before your absence begins; and\n\n  * Submit a maternity certificate (form MAT B1) or other statement from a medical practitioner or certified midwife confirming the expected week of childbirth.\n\n\n\n\nSMP is payable for a maximum of 39 weeks. This pay period can start at any time from the 11th week before the expected week of childbirth up to the expected week of childbirth without any loss of SMP. Within this limit, you may choose when your maternity pay period begins.\n\nSMP is not payable if the pregnancy ends other than by a live birth before the 25th week of pregnancy. In these circumstances SSP should be considered. In the event of a still birth after the 24th week of pregnancy you will be entitled to the same amount of\n\nmaternity leave and pay as if the baby was born alive. Please contact your HR Advisor for further information.\n\nThe agency recognises that this will be a difficult and traumatic time and would encourage the use of the confidential assistance programme, Workplace Wellness. Their number is 0800 111 6387\n\nIf you are expecting more than one baby during a pregnancy, you are only entitled to one payment of SMP.\n\n#### 3\\. Amount of SMP payable\n\nSMP is payable for complete weeks only, starting at midnight between a Saturday and Sunday, for a maximum of 39 weeks. It is paid on your normal pay-day and subject to PAYE income tax and National Insurance contributions.\n\nSMP is paid at the rate of 90% of earnings for the first six weeks and, for the remaining 33 weeks, the lesser of (a) the standard flat rate (refer to government website for current figures https://www.gov.uk/maternity-pay-leave/pay) or (b) 90% of normal weekly earnings\n\n#### 4\\. Statutory maternity leave and maternity allowance\n\nWomen not entitled to SMP may be entitled to Maternity Allowance (MA) from the Department of Work and Pensions. The claim for MA should be made on form MA1 (available from any Jobcentre Plus office) and submitted with evidence of pregnancy (MAT B1) on or after the 14th week before the expected week of childbirth.\n\nA deduction equivalent to the standard rate of MA will be made automatically from salary if it appears that entitlement to MA exists. If MA is not payable then you should send the notification form to HR so that payment of salary can be corrected. If you do not claim the full benefit to which you are entitled, the full deduction will nevertheless be made unless HR is satisfied with the explanation given. You may also be entitled to other statutory benefits e.g. Incapacity Benefit or Working Families Tax Credit and should contact Jobcentre Plus for details of entitlement and claims. If SMP is not payable HR will notify you, provide you with form SMP1 and return your maternity certificate (form MAT B1). If you wish to claim Maternity Allowance, you should take both forms to your local Jobcentre Plus office.\n\nIf you disagree with the decision not to pay SMP, you can ask HR to provide a written statement giving reasons. If you still disagree, you can ask the Adjudication Officer at any Jobcentre Plus office to adjudicate.\n\n#### 5\\. Additional maternity leave\n\nYou will be entitled to take 26 weeks additional maternity leave immediately after ordinary maternity leave (OML). The first 13 weeks of additional maternity leave will be paid at SMP rates and the remaining 13 weeks will be unpaid.\n\n### Part three: All employees\n\n#### 1\\. Starting maternity leave\n\nIf you are entitled to paid maternity leave or statutory maternity pay, you may begin your leave at any time from a date which is after the 11th week before the expected week of childbirth. Unpaid maternity leave can, however, start up to 14 weeks before the expected date of childbirth. If it is considered advisable for you to begin leave shortly before your intended date (e.g. on safety grounds) you will be given special leave with pay for the additional absence if it does not qualify as paid sick leave.\n\nIf childbirth occurs prior to the 11th week before the expected week of childbirth, maternity leave will commence from the day after childbirth (childbirth means the birth of a live child or a still birth after 24 weeks of pregnancy). If you have notified your intention to start maternity leave later than the 4th week before the expected week of childbirth and have been continuously on pregnancy related sick leave, the start of the maternity leave will be the start of the continuous absence or the 4th week date, whichever is later.\n\nOnce you have stated when you would wish your maternity leave to start this date would not normally be changed unless you inform the Agency of the new date and give at least 28 days\u2019 notice of this. In response to receiving the application form, HR will write to you confirming the date your maternity leave (paid and unpaid) is due to end. You will be expected to return to work on that date (see Returning to Work, below).\n\n#### 2\\. Unpaid maternity leave\n\nDuring or following pregnancy you will be allowed to take 26 weeks ordinary maternity leave (OML) followed by 26 weeks additional maternity leave (AML). This does not affect your right to Shared Parental Leave and Parental Leave (see also Special Leave and Shared Parental Leave guidance).\n\n#### 3\\. Returning to work\n\nApart from during the two weeks following the birth of the baby, if you are absent from work because of pregnancy or childbirth and entitled to paid maternity leave, you may return to work (provided you have given prior written notice of your intention to return) at any time up to 52 weeks from the start of her maternity period. You will have been notified by HR of the date when your maternity leave (paid and unpaid) is due to end. Should you wish to return before this date, you should give at least 28 days written notice of the day on which you propose to return. You must give this notice by completing a \u201cNotice of Intention to Return to Work following Maternity Leave\u201d; (see Appendix C). The notice should be a meaningful declaration of intent, i.e. your medical condition at that time is such that a return to work is a realistic expectation.\n\nWhere the maternity leave period is due to end, or you provide at least 28 days notification of your intention to return to work on an earlier date, certificated sick absence may be allowed from this date, in accordance with agency managing sickness absence policy. In\n\nthese circumstances, you will not be allowed to bring forward the date of intended return in order to qualify for paid sick absence from an earlier date. If you exercise your right to return to work after ordinary maternity leave (i.e. the first 26 weeks of maternity leave) you are entitled to return to the same job on the same terms and conditions of employment as if you had not been on maternity leave, unless a redundancy situation has arisen. In these circumstances you would be offered a suitable alternative vacancy.\n\nAfter additional maternity leave (i.e. the period up to 52 weeks) you are entitled to return to work to the same job on the same terms and conditions as if you had not been on maternity leave, unless there is some reason why it is not reasonably practicable for you to do so. In this case you will normally be employed in the same general location but not necessarily in the same post as before. In any event, you will be treated for posting and transfer purposes no less favourably than if you had not been on maternity leave.\n\nIf you have not informed the Agency previously and decide not to return to work following your maternity leave, the usual leaver process should be followed and you should confirm your resignation in writing to your line manager. You will need to provide the required notice as set out in your contract.\n\n#### 4\\. Contractual benefits\n\nDuring the period of maternity leave the contract of employment continues and you are entitled to all the benefits (except remuneration in the case of unpaid leave) which would have accrued had you been at work. You will continue to accrue annual leave entitlement during your maternity leave and will also accrue leave for any public or bank holidays and privilege days that occur during that period.\n\nYou may take annual leave before or after, but not during, your maternity absence (whether paid or unpaid).\n\nIf you have opted into a salary sacrifice to purchase vouchers prior to commencing your maternity leave, this will be suspended if you are on SMP or Nil pay.\n\n#### 5\\. Ante-natal care\n\nIf, on medical advice, you make an appointment to receive ante-natal care, you will be given reasonable time off to keep the appointment. Ante-natal care normally covers appointments to see doctors, midwives or health visitors responsible for that care. You may also be allowed time off with pay to attend relaxation or parent craft classes, providing you supply evidence of enrolment and details of future appointments. You should discuss any appointments with your line manager to ensure there is minimal disruption to your work. You may be required to work flexibility to accommodate any appointments and this may include working from home.\n\n#### 6\\. Sick leave during or following pregnancy\n\nIf a pregnancy related illness occurs during or following pregnancy, (i.e. outside the period of childbirth), it will not be used as a trigger point in the absence policy. All sickness absence should be recorded on Oracle as per the normal reporting rules and the reason\n\nrecorded as \u2018pregnancy related\u2019. For advice on what constitutes pregnancy related illness, please contact your HR Advisor.\n\nSelf-certificates and medical certificates, as appropriate, must be submitted for a pregnancy related illness. For illness unrelated to pregnancy, normal Agency sickness absence arrangements apply.\n\nIf you have a miscarriage before the 25th week of pregnancy then normal sick leave provisions will apply.\n\nIf you are unable to return to work at the end of your ordinary or additional maternity leave the usual arrangements for sickness absence apply.\n\nIf you are not entitled to contractual sick pay, you may be entitled to Statutory Sick Pay (SSP), but you will be disqualified from receiving Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) during the 26 weeks starting with either:-\n\na. the beginning of the week you are first entitled to Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP); or\n\nb. the beginning of the week you are first entitled to Maternity Allowance (MA); or\n\nc. the beginning of the sixth week before the expected week of childbirth if you are entitled to SMP or MA and work beyond that date; or\n\nd. the beginning of the sixth week before the expected week of childbirth if you are not entitled to SMP or MA.\n\nThe disqualification will remain in force as long as a period of incapacity for work or linked period of incapacity for work remains in force.\n\n#### 7\\. IVF\n\nAppointments for IVF treatment will not be regarded as antenatal appointments; these will be dealt with as special leave. Absences resulting directly from the process of IVF will be dealt with as sickness absence and consideration will be taken regarding these being counted towards attendance management warning triggers.\n\n#### 8\\. Contact during maternity leave\n\nThe agency reserves the right to maintain reasonable contact with you during your maternity leave. This may be to discuss your plans for return to work, to discuss any special arrangements to be made or training to be given to ease your return to work or to update you on developments at work during your absence.\n\nYou should agree with your line manager prior to commencing maternity leave how you wish to be informed of any new vacancies in your division. You will still have access to Insite whilst you are on maternity leave.\n\n#### 9\\. Keeping in touch (KIT days)\n\nApart from the two weeks following childbirth, during your maternity leave, you may attend\n\nwork or carry out some other activity, e.g. attend a training course. You will be able to take up to 10 KIT days (which need not be consecutive) to enable you to keep in touch with your job or with developments in the workplace. These keeping in touch days are entirely voluntary and may only be worked if both you and your line manager agree to the arrangement.\n\nIf you choose to use the KIT days you will not be able to extend the overall 52-week maternity leave period by the number of days worked. Any part of a day worked will count as one day. You will be paid in full for any day worked, but will not be entitled to receive contractual maternity pay, SMP or MA in addition on that day.\n\n#### 10\\. Expressing milk\n\nThe agency provides a dedicated rest room for new mothers. Employees can use the contemplation room to express milk. The rest room is located on the Ground floor at BPR and in the Night Duty room at NIBSC.\n\n#### 11\\. Performance related pay\n\nIf you are on maternity leave in a standard reporting year (paid or unpaid) you will be entitled to a PRP increase based upon an assessment of your performance during the part of the year when you were at work. If you have been at work for 3 months or more before going on maternity leave you should complete your PRP with your line manager before your maternity leave starts or arrange to do this during a KIT day (see above). If you have worked for less than 3 months during the standard reporting year, you will receive a PRP rating of \u2018Good\u2019. Your pay award will be paid from the date you return to work.\n\n#### 12\\. Protection against discrimination\n\nAll women have the right to protection from detrimental treatment on the grounds of pregnancy. This means, amongst other rights, that you cannot be dismissed because of pregnancy or childbirth or any reason connected with it during your maternity leave. If during maternity leave a redundancy situation occurs and it is impracticable to continue to employ you in the same post, you will be offered suitable alternative employment to a vacancy where possible.\n\n#### 13\\. Right to request flexible working\n\nAll employees may request to work flexibly. Additionally, employees with 26 weeks\u2019 service with the agency have a legal right to make a request once in a 12-month period to work flexibly. Please refer to the Flexible working policy for further information.\n\n#### 14\\. Career breaks\n\nAll employees who have passed their probation period may submit a request to take a career break. Career breaks are an employee benefit, not an employment right and are granted at the discretion of the agency. All requests for career breaks will be considered against current and forecast business needs at the time the request is made. Please refer to the Career break policy for further information.\n\n### Additional documents\n\n[Maternity leave: appendix A - maternity risk assessment template for new or expectant mothers](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5bacf327e5274a3de9f14153/Maternity_leave_-_APPENDIX_A_.pdf) (PDF, 86.3 KB, 7 pages)\n\n[Maternity leave: appendix B - application for maternity leave](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5bacf33be5274a3dfa2a9762/Maternity_leave_-_APPENDIX_B.pdf) (PDF, 102 KB, 3 pages)\n\n[Maternity leave: appendix C - notice of intention to return to work](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5bacf35240f0b62db2c11584/Maternity_leave_-_APPENDIX_C.pdf) (PDF, 114 KB, 3 pages)\n\n## Paternity Leave policy & procedure\n\nJanuary 2018\n\nPolicy review date: 31/05/2018\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (the \u2018Agency\u2019) is committed to supporting staff in their obligations to their family. This Paternity Leave Policy has been designed to ensure that all members of staff are treated fairly and consistently and in line with relevant legislation.\n\nThe purpose of the policy is to set out the Agency\u2019s provision for Paternity Leave for employees who become parents. Paternity Leave is intended to support parents in the early stage of a child\u2019s life. Following the birth or placement of a child, eligible employees can take up to two weeks\u2019 paid paternity leave to care for the child and/or to support the other parent.\n\n### 1\\. Scope\n\nThis policy is applicable to all employees if their partner is having a baby, adopting a child or having a baby through a surrogacy arrangement and meet the eligible criteria below.\n\n### 2\\. Eligibility\n\nPaternity leave is available to employees who wish to take time off to look after the child and they are:\n\n  * the biological father of the child or the spouse or partner of the mother who will give birth\n  * the spouse or partner of the primary adopter*\n  * the intended parent (if you are having a baby through a surrogacy arrangement)*\n  * have or expect to have responsibility for the child\u2019s upbringing; and\n  * have worked continuously for the Agency for 26 weeks ending with the 15th week before the baby is due;\n\n\n\nor\n\n  * in the case of adoption and fostering, you will have worked continuously for 26 weeks by the \u2018matching week\u2019, i.e. at the end of the week in which the adopter/prospective adopter is notified of being matched with the child (UK adoptions), or the date the child enters the UK (overseas adoptions).\n\n\n\n*In the case of couples who are adopting a child or having a child through a surrogacy arrangement, adoption leave and pay are available to only one member of the couple. The other person can take paternity leave.\n\nEmployees with less than the 26 weeks continuous service are not eligible for paternity leave\n\n  1. Entitlement\n\n\n\nEmployees who meet the above eligibility criteria can choose to take either one week or two consecutive weeks of paternity leave. Paternity leave must be taken in a single block and cannot be taken as odd days or as two separate weeks. A week is the same amount of days that you normally work in a week, for example if you only work on Mondays and Tuesdays a week is 2 days.\n\nDuring paternity leave, eligible employees will be paid by the Agency at their normal rate of pay. (This will include an element of Statutory Paternity Pay (SPP) where appropriate, which is effectively enhanced by the Agency to equal full pay).\n\nEmployees can take only one period of leave per pregnancy even if more than one baby is born as the result of the same pregnancy.\n\n### 4\\. Start and end dates of Paternity Leave\n\nPaternity leave can\u2019t start until the birth of the baby; employees may be able to take some annual leave before. Employees will need to take their paternity leave within 56 days and can choose to take their leave on any day of the week:\n\n  * from the date of the child\u2019s birth, placement or arrival in the UK (whether this is earlier or later than expected), or\n  * a chosen number of days or weeks after the date of birth, placement or arrival in the UK (whether this is earlier or later than expected), or\n  * from a chosen date after the expected date of birth or placement\n\n\n\n### 5\\. Notification process\n\nEmployees should discuss their intention to take paternity leave with their line manager as early as possible so that early consideration can be given to covering their work during their absence.\n\nTo qualify for paternity leave employees must formally inform the Agency by completing the Paternity Leave Application Form \u2013 Annex A and submit it alongside any relevant paperwork on Fusion. The form must be submitted:\n\n  * in the case of births, including surrogate births, by the end of the 15th week before the baby is due, or, if this is not possible, as soon as is reasonably practicable\n  * in the case of adoptions or fostering for adoption, within 7 days of the adopter being advised of being matched with the child or, if this is not reasonably practicable, as soon as is reasonably practicable\n\n\n\nEmployees who are eligible, can choose to take either one week or two consecutive weeks\u2019 paid paternity leave (not odd days).\n\n### 6\\. Paternity Pay\n\nTo qualify for paternity pay, employees must:\n\n  * have worked continuously for the Agency for at least 26 weeks by the end of the 15th week before the expected week of childbirth (known as the \u2018qualifying week\u2019)\n  * be employed by the Agency up to the date of birth/matching week\n  * earn at least \u00a3113 a week (before tax)\n  * give the correct notice (as above)\n\n\n\nTax and National Insurance will be deducted as usual from paternity pay. Paternity pay is paid at an enhanced rate as follows: Length of service Paternity leave Paternity pay 1 year or more 2 weeks 2 weeks\u2019 full pay (inclusive of occupational paternity pay) 26 weeks to less than a year 2 weeks 2 weeks\u2019 statutory paternity pay or 90% of your average weekly earnings (whichever is lower)\n\n### 7\\. Antenatal Appointments\n\nEmployees can take unpaid leave to accompany a pregnant woman to 2 antenatal appointments if you are:\n\n  * the baby\u2019s father\n  * the expectant mother\u2019s spouse, partner or civil partner\n  * in a long-term relationship with the expectant mother\n  * the intended parent (if you\u2019re having a baby through a surrogacy arrangement)\n  * or 2 adoption appointments after you have been matched with a child\n\n\n\n### 8\\. If you lose your baby\n\nIn the sad circumstances of the pregnancy ending in stillbirth after 24 weeks of pregnancy (defined as stillbirth) or born alive at any point during the pregnancy, an employee will still be entitled to Paternity Leave as outlined above.\n\nEmployees can also obtain support through the Agency\u2019s independent Employee Assistance Programme (EAP), Workplace Wellness. Details can be found on INsite.\n\n### 9\\. Shared Parental Leave\n\nEmployees may be able to get Shared Parental Leave (SPL) and Statutory Shared Parental Pay (ShPP) if they\u2019ve had a baby or adopted a child.\n\nEmployees can start SPL if they\u2019re eligible and they or their partner end their maternity or adoption leave or pay early. The remaining leave will be available as SPL. The remaining pay may be available as ShPP.\n\nEmployees can take SPL in up to 3 separate blocks. They can also share the leave with their partner if they\u2019re also eligible. Parents can choose how much of the SPL each of them will take.\n\n### 10\\. Further information\n\nShould you have any queries regarding this policy, further information can be sought from your HR Coordinator.\n\n### Additional documents\n\n[Paternity Leave: annex1 - paternity leave application form](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5bae16c9e5274a3de9f1416b/Paternity-leave_-annex_1.pdf) (PDF, 54.2 KB, 1 page)\n\n## Shared Parental Leave policy\n\n### Policy statement\n\nThe Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency is committed to being a good modern employer and to offering employees and family friendly employment policies that support business needs. This approach supports employee motivation and work life balance. It also helps retain talented employees.\n\n### Purpose\n\nShared parental leave (SPL) is a statutory entitlement to flexible parental leave and pay, available to both parents on an equal basis. Legislative provisions to implement SPL are set out in the Children and Families Act 2014 and statutory instruments made under the powers in the Act.\n\nSPL aims to:\n\n  * allow working parents to share the care of their children\n  * enable working fathers to take a more active role in caring for their children\n  * reduce the gender bias that currently impacts on women\u2019s careers.\n\n\n\nWhere a woman and her partner meet the qualifying conditions for SPL, the woman can end her maternity leave and pay, or commit to ending it at a future date and share the untaken balance of maternity leave and pay as SPL and pay. For adoptive parents, the primary adopter will have to bring their adoption leave period to an end before they or their partner are entitled to SPL.\n\n### Scope\n\nThis policy and related procedure apply to all employees who meet the eligibility criteria (length of service and economic activity) for SPL as set out in the Shared Parental Leave Procedure. Each parent will need to qualify for leave and pay in their own right. This policy applies to births where the expected week of childbirth begins on or after 5 April 2015 and to adoptions where a child is matched or placed for adoption on or after 5 April 2015.\n\n### Policy principles\n\nThe following principles and values underpin this policy: * protection \u2013 retained protection for pregnant women and mothers immediately before and after childbirth. * flexibility \u2013 increased flexibility for employers and employees giving a choice on how employment and caring is shared between parents. * simplicity \u2013 straightforward procedures, easy to access and manage. * shared responsibility \u2013 a system more balanced between genders that allows negotiation of leave patterns between employer and working parents.\n\n### Further information\n\nFurther information and advice about SPL is available in the Shared Parental Leave Procedure, the \u2018How to\u2019 guides, Frequently Asked Questions and Glossary.\n\n## Shared Parental Leave procedure\n\n### Introduction\n\n  1. Shared parental leave (SPL) and shared parental pay (ShPP) provide parents with the opportunity to share the care of their child in the first year, whilst balancing their work and retaining their link to the labour market.\n\n  2. SPL is available to both parents, including adopters and their partners, with main caring responsibilities for a child. It is a statutory entitlement in addition to maternity, paternity and adoption leave. SPL allows eligible parents the choice to end the mother\u2019s maternity leave and pay, or the primary adopter\u2019s adoption leave and pay early, and share the untaken balance as SPL and ShPP. The mother or primary adopter must still take their two weeks post birth compulsory maternity leave or first two weeks adoption leave.\n\n  3. This Procedure should be used by employees and line managers for the application and management of SPL within the agency. It supports the Shared Parental Leave Policy and should be used in conjunction with the \u201cHow to guides\u201d. Where necessary, line managers should consult HR for advice.\n\n  4. A flowchart showing the overview of eligibility is at Annex A.\n\n\n\n\n### Definitions\n\n  1. In this document the following terms and definitions apply:\n\n\n  * Mother \u2013 the birth mother of the child\n  * Primary adopter \u2013 the person with whom the adoptive child is expected to be placed and who has primary care for the child\n  * Partner \u2013 this can be a child\u2019s biological father, the mother\u2019s partner, or the primary adopter\u2019s partner who can be their husband/wife, civil partner or partner living in an enduring relationship with them and the child\n  * Parent \u2013 refers to the birth parents of the child and to adoptive parents or intended parents in surrogacy arrangements\n  * Expected week of childbirth (EWC) in relation to a child means the week, beginning on a Sunday, in which the doctor or midwife expects the child to be born.\n\n\n\n### Roles and responsibilities\n\n  1. The individual roles and responsibilities of line managers and employees in the application process are set out in the following guidance:\n\n\n  * How to: apply for shared parental leave \u2013 Advice for employees\n  * How to: consider shared parental leave requests \u2013 Advice for line managers.\n\n\n\n### Eligibility\n\n  1. SPL and ShPP applies to births where the EWC begins on or after 5 April 2015 and to adoptions where a child is matched or placed for adoption on or after 5 April 2015. The EWC on the maternity certificate (form MATB1) will be used to establish eligibility, irrespective of the actual birth date.\n\n  2. To qualify for statutory SPL and ShPP, both parents (mother/primary adopter and her partner) must meet an economic activity test relating to employment and earnings and an individual test relating to duration of service as well as having main caring responsibility for the child:\n\n\n\n  * Stage 1 - the joint or economic activity test\n\n\n\nIn order to qualify, an employed person must have a partner who:\n\na) shares the main responsibility for the care of the child and is either:\n\n  * their husband, wife, civil partner or joint adopter\n\n  * the child\u2019s other parent\n\n  * their partner.\n\n\n\n\nb) declares that they meet the employment and earnings test. This requires them to have worked for any 26 out of the 66 weeks leading up to the EWC or the adoption matching date and earned at least \u00a330 gross a week for any 13 of those 66 weeks.\n\n  * Stage 2 - the individual test\n\n\n\na) to be eligible for SPL, each parent must have at least 26 weeks continuous service with their respective employer by the end of the 15th week, before the EWC or adoption matching date. They must also still be working for the same respective employer when they intend to take the leave.\n\nb) to be eligible for ShPP each parent must have 26 weeks continuous service with their respective employer at the 15th week before the EWC or adoption placement date. Earnings for the eight week period prior to the 15th week before the EWC or adoption placement date must be over the lower earnings limit.\n\n  1. Employees in a surrogacy arrangement, who are eligible and intend to apply for a parental order, and employees adopting through an approved agency and applying for an adoption order, may also be eligible for SPL. They can opt into SPL once they have accessed adoption leave and pay. Information on approved adoption agencies and parental orders is in the Frequently Asked Questions section.\n\n  2. The mother/primary adopter and their partner need to jointly consider whether they meet the qualifying criteria for SPL. This also applies to prospective parents who have a child placed with them under fostering to adopt arrangements.\n\n\n\n\n### Entitlement\n\n  1. Shared parental leave (SPL) and shared parental pay (ShPP) is a joint entitlement.\n\n  2. Before any SPL and ShPP can be taken, maternity/adoption leave and pay must have ended or there must be a commitment to bring the maternity/adoption leave and pay to an end at a later date.\n\n  3. All employed mothers/primary adopters (including intended parents in surrogacy arrangements) are entitled to 52 weeks of statutory maternity/adoption leave regardless of their length of service. Entitlements to different levels of paid leave and how and when to provide notification are set out in the Maternity/Adoption Policy and Procedures. The Maternity Policy and Adoption Policy can be found on the agency intranet.\n\n  4. As long as a mother has taken her two week post birth compulsory maternity leave period, she will be able to bring her maternity leave to an end early and convert the untaken balance of leave into SPL. If eligible, both parents can choose to share the untaken balance of maternity leave as SPL and ShPP.\n\n  5. A primary adopter must take their first two weeks adoption leave before they are able to bring their adoption leave to an end early and convert the untaken balance into SPL. If eligible, both primary and secondary adopters can choose to share the untaken balance of adoption leave as SPL and ShPP.\n\n  6. SPL can be taken by the partner concurrently with the mother/primary adopter on maternity/adoption leave or both parents can be on SPL together. The combined leave taken by the parents must not exceed their joint entitlement.\n\n  7. If circumstances change and the mother/primary adopter and/or their partner no longer have caring responsibility for the child, they must immediately inform their line managers that they are no longer entitled to SPL.\n\n\n\n\n### False declaration\n\n  1. If an employee fraudulently or negligently gives incorrect information, or makes a false statement or declaration about their circumstances, this will be considered a disciplinary offence. Action will be taken in accordance with the agency misconduct procedures (Poor Performance & Misconduct Policy).\n\n\n\n### Pay\n\n  1. The agency will pay ShPP as follows.\n\n\n  * Eligible employees will be entitled to claim ShPP of up to 39 weeks (less any weeks of statutory maternity pay, maternity allowance or statutory adoption pay already claimed) within one year from the birth or placement.\n  * For 26 of those weeks leave, occupational ShPP will be paid at full pay, less any weeks statutory maternity pay, maternity allowance or statutory adoption pay and leave already taken.\n  * The remaining 26 weeks of SPL will be paid at statutory rate for 13 weeks and 13 weeks unpaid. This mirrors the agency\u2019s occupational maternity pay arrangements.\n  * Regardless of whether one or both parents work in the Civil Service, the amount of ShPP entitlement is counted down from when the 39 weeks of statutory maternity pay, maternity allowance or statutory adoption pay starts.\n  * The agency will not pay more than 26 weeks full maternity pay, adoption pay or ShPP in aggregate to an eligible couple within the Civil Service, as this is a joint entitlement.\n  * SPL and ShPP can be taken at any time during the first year following the birth or placement for adoption, so long as the compulsory maternity period, or two weeks adoption leave, has been taken.\n\n\n  1. Payment of occupational ShPP is conditional upon eligible employees:\n\n\n  * being in paid service at the time their SPL begins and having one year\u2019s Civil Service service\n\n  * stating their intention to return to work in the Civil Service after their final period of SPL. Employees are required to give at least 28 days\u2019 notice of their intention to return and to complete at least one further calendar months\u2019 service, in accordance with the Maternity Policy.\n\n  * agreeing to repay any occupational ShPP received (less any statutory ShPP) if they do not return to work in the Civil Service.\n\n\n\n\n### Ante-natal and pre-adoption appointments\n\n  1. Pregnant women are entitled to reasonable paid leave to attend ante-natal appointments (see the Maternity Policy for more information). Fathers, or an expectant mother\u2019s partner, have a right to take paid time off work to accompany a pregnant woman to attend up to two ante-natal appointments This covers the actual time needed to attend the appointments up to a limit of six and half hours per appointment. There is no qualifying length of service required in order to exercise this right. The Maternity Policy, Adoption Policy and Special Leave Policy can be found on the agency intranet.\n\n  2. This statutory right is available to the husband, civil partner, or partner of the pregnant woman, the father or parent of the expected child, or intended parents in surrogacy cases who meet specified conditions relating to Parental Orders under the Human Embryology and Fertilisation Act 2008.\n\n  3. The mother retains the right to decide if her partner, or the intended parents in surrogacy arrangements, can attend these appointments with her.\n\n  4. Employed couples who are adopting are entitled to time off to attend pre-adoption appointments. This includes prospective adopters with whom a child is placed under a \u201cfostering to adopt\u201d arrangement.\n\n\n\n\n### Requesting leave for ante-natal or adoption appointments\n\n  1. A mother\u2019s partner has the right to take time off in order to attend two ante-natal appointments. This covers the actual time needed to attend the appointments up to a limit of six and half hours per appointment. Employees should advise their line manager of the appointment dates and times as early as possible.\n\n  2. The primary adopter is entitled to take paid time off work to attend up to five pre-adoption appointments. The secondary adopter or partner is entitled to take paid time off to attend up to two pre-adoption appointments. This covers the actual time needed to attend the appointments and is limited to six and half hours per appointment.\n\n  3. If requested, adoptive parents will need to provide evidence to their line managers that the local authority has requested their attendance at adoption meetings.\n\n  4. Line managers and employees should discuss whether working from home or flexibly around appointments would help minimise their absence from work. The Flexible Working Policy is available on the agency intranet.\n\n\n\n\n### Notice to end maternity leave\n\n  1. A mother on maternity leave can end her maternity leave either by returning to work or by giving notice that she will end her leave and/or pay on a date following the two week compulsory period (four weeks for factory workers) after the birth of her child. Notice must be given using the SPL and ShPP Form. Where notice to end maternity leave is accompanied with notification by the mother or her partner to take SPL, the notice to end maternity leave is binding.\n\n  2. The maternity leave will end on that date, whether or not the mother returns to work, unless the mother revokes any notice given prior to childbirth, within six weeks following the birth.\n\n  3. Ending or committing to end maternity leave and pay on a specific date determines the number of weeks entitlement to SPL and ShPP. Eligible parents can share the remaining balance of leave as SPL (up to 50 weeks) and ShPP (up to 37 weeks). If the mother returns to work in advance of the date given on the notice, the entitlement to SPL and ShPP will still be based on the original end date.\n\n\n\n\n### Notice to end adoption leave\n\n  1. To end their adoption leave and/or pay, primary adopters on adoption leave must give at least eight weeks\u2019 notice and have taken the first two weeks as statutory adoption leave. This notice must also be at least one week before the last day of the statutory adoption leave period. Notice must be given using the SPL and ShPP Form.\n\n  2. Adoption leave will end on the date notified, whether or not the adopter returns to work.\n\n  3. Ending or committing to end adoption leave on a specific date determines the number of weeks entitlement to SPL and ShPP. Eligible parents can share the remaining untaken balance of leave as SPL (up to 50 weeks) and ShPP (up to 37 weeks). If the primary adopter returns to work in advance of the date given on the notice, the entitlement to SPL and ShPP will still be based on the original end date.\n\n\n\n\n### Revoking a binding notice to end maternity leave\n\n  1. To opt into SPL, a birth mother will have given binding notice to end her maternity leave early without taking her full maternity entitlement.\n\n  2. She can revoke binding notice given prior to childbirth, up to six weeks following childbirth, providing she has not returned to work. This is because returning to work will automatically end her maternity leave.\n\n  3. Her partner must immediately inform their employer of any change to their entitlement to SPL.\n\n  4. If a birth mother has revoked her notice in the six weeks following childbirth, she can still submit binding notice to end maternity leave at a later date, by giving eight weeks notice.\n\n\n\n\n### Providing notification for SPL\n\n  1. For parents to access SPL and ShPP, the mother/primary adopter will first need to give their employer at least eight weeks\u2019 notice of their intention to end maternity/adoption leave. Where notice to end maternity leave is accompanied with notification by the mother or her partner to take SPL, the notice to end maternity leave is binding. The mother\u2019s/primary adopter\u2019s maternity/adoption leave and maternity/adoption pay period will cease on the day specified on the notice.\n\n  2. Notification periods for SPL are the same for the mother/primary adopter and their partner in maternity, adoption, and surrogacy arrangements.\n\n  3. An employee will need to give their line manager a minimum of eight weeks\u2019 notice of intention to take SPL using the SPL and ShPP Form. This includes a non-binding indication of the expected pattern of leave to give an early indication to line managers of the intended leave pattern.\n\n  4. The notice can be submitted at any time, provided that a minimum of eight weeks\u2019 notice is given for each period of leave. Early notification allows employees and line managers to begin discussions about dates and patterns of leave sooner and plan for absences. If the notification is submitted only eight weeks before the first day of the first period of leave this notification will also become the binding notice of SPL (detailed below). More detailed information on notice periods is in the Frequently Asked Questions section and in the \u201cHow to guides.\u201d\n\n  5. Line managers must request the following as evidence to ensure an employee\u2019s entitlement to SPL:\n\n\n\n  * a copy of the child\u2019s birth certificate or, if unavailable, a declaration signed by both parents stating the date and location of birth \u2013 If the request is made before the birth of the child this must be provided within 14 days of the child\u2019s birth. If the request is made after the birth of the child this must be provided within 14 days of the request\n\n\n\nor * a copy of a matching document issued by the adoption agency, notifying that the child is to be placed with the primary adopter \u2013 This must be provided by the employee within 14 days of the request\n\nand * the name and address of their partner\u2019s employer \u2013 This must be provided within 14 days of the request.\n\n### Fostering to adopt\n\n  1. In fostering to adopt arrangements, \u2018looked after children\u2019 are placed with approved foster parents who agree to adopt the child with little or no notice, if the parental rights of the birth parents are terminated.\n\n  2. In these circumstances, employees will be unable to provide the usual notice required prior to their absence on adoption leave. Foster to adopt parents are specially trained in placements that are likely to lead to adoption. Therefore, prospective parents in this situation are encouraged to have early discussions with their line manager to help prepare for absences at short notice.\n\n\n\n\n### SPL pattern requests\n\n  1. SPL allows working parents to take short periods of leave in minimum one week blocks. This enables them to intersperse periods of work with periods of leave and to take leave at the same time if they choose to. Each employed parent agrees their pattern of leave with their line manager.\n\n  2. To confirm their leave requirements, an employee must provide their line manager with binding notice of SPL on the SPL and ShPP Form, signed by them and their partner.\n\n\n\n\nThis must be received a minimum of eight weeks before the employee intends to be absent on SPL. It does not need to include details of all the requested SPL and all discontinuous weeks. Any subsequent leave requests will require an eight week notice period and be subjected to the limit of three notifications. This limit includes the initial request of SPL and any previously notified SPL requests. There can only be three formal notifications for leave or changes to periods of SPL overall.\n\n  1. Line managers will need to check through BMS that their employee meets the qualifying criteria for SPL and ShPP. They should consider the needs of the business before agreeing any periods of discontinuous weeks of SPL in a single notice. At no point will the respective line managers of each parent be expected to contact one another.\n\n  2. During the first two weeks of the eight week notice period, the line manager and employee should discuss and agree sign-off of the leave pattern(s). An employee may withdraw a notice without penalty in these two weeks.\n\n  3. If the employee and line manager cannot reach agreement, the employee is entitled to take their SPL in a single block commencing on a date specified by the employee. This start date can be provided up to five days after the two week discussion period, provided the leave period starts no sooner than eight weeks from the submission of the original notification.\n\n  4. If a line manager fails to respond to an employee\u2019s notice of SPL and requested pattern, the SPL will revert to the default position of a continuous period of leave for the total amount of SPL requested in the pattern. The employee will have five days from the end of the two week discussion period to notify their line manager of when that continuous period will start. This must not be within eight weeks of the original submission of the request, but can be later. If the employee does not specify a start date then the SPL will start on the first date stated in their original request.\n\n\n\n\n### Requests to change SPL patterns\n\n  1. Once an employee has submitted notice of a period of SPL they will only be able to withdraw that request within the two week discussion period at the beginning of the eight weeks notice. To make changes after this point they would need to submit a formal change notification, which would be included in the limit of up to three notifications overall.\n\n  2. If already within a period of agreed leave, this will continue until agreement of a new leave pattern is reached and the required notice period is completed. Notice periods may be waived due to unforeseen circumstances.\n\n  3. Changes which are mutually beneficial to the business and the employee can be made without this counting towards the limit of three notifications.\n\n\n\n\n### Managing SPL\n\n  1. It is important for employees and their line managers to keep in touch during extended periods of absence from the workplace. This enables line managers and employees to be kept updated on changes within the workplace, or personal circumstances, which can ease the employees return to work.\n\n\n\n### SPL in Touch (SPLIT) Days\n\n  1. The right to maternity \u201cKeeping in Touch\u201d (KIT) days remains until maternity leave ends. Once SPL begins, each parent can have up to 20 SPLIT days each to use whilst on SPL. It is anticipated that SPLIT days will be used to enable an employee to return to work for one or more days in the weeks they are absent on SPL for training/keeping up to speed with changes in work, part time working or a phased return to work. Full pay will apply for these days and they may only be used with the agreement of the employer and the employee.\n\n\n\n### Leaving the agency\n\n  1. If an employee leaves the agency and the civil service as a whole during a period of SPL, they are no longer eligible for SPL and ShPP. An employee will need to repay any occupational ShPP paid during their SPL, excluding statutory ShPP.\n\n  2. If an employee transfers to another government department, they remain in civil service employment. As there is no break in continuity of service, their entitlement to SPL and ShPP is unlikely to be affected. However, if an employee has agreed an SPL pattern with their previous department they will need an early discussion of these arrangements with their new line manager to ensure they can be honoured.\n\n  3. If SPL is taken during a loan or secondment period, line managers and employees should refer to agency guidance on loans and secondments. The secondment or loan agreement should be discussed by the contracting parties.\n\n\n\n\n### Right to return\n\n  1. Employees who end their right to maternity or adoption leave will no longer benefit from specific rights associated with maternity or adoption leave. However, similar rights are provided under SPL.\n\n  2. Under SPL, the right to return to the same job is maintained for all employees returning from any period of leave (maternity, paternity, adoption, or SPL) that totals 26 weeks or less in aggregate, even if the leave is taken in discontinuous blocks. Up to four weeks of unpaid parental leave are disregarded for the purpose of the right to return to the same job.\n\n  3. Employees also have the right to return to the same job, or, if it is not reasonably practical for the employer, enter another job which is both suitable and appropriate for them, if:\n\n\n\n  * total SPL taken when added to any other period of relevant statutory leave is more than 26 weeks; or\n  * a period of SPL was consecutive with a period of parental leave of more than four weeks; or\n  * a period of SPL was the last of two or more consecutive periods of relevant statutory leave of more than four weeks.\n\n\n  1. Line managers should follow agency guidance on risk assessments for new and expectant mothers throughout the pregnancy and on the mother\u2019s return from maternity and/or SPL in the six month period following birth. Details of the agency\u2019s pregnancy risk assessments may be found within the Health and Safety section of the intranet.\n\n  2. If an employee would like to return to work using a different working pattern, this is considered in line with the \u2018Flexible Working Policy\u2019 and supporting documents, which may be found on the HR pages of the intranet. When considering an application for a different working pattern, line managers will try to accommodate the request, but there can be no guarantee that it will be agreed.\n\n\n\n\n### Further information\n\n  1. For further information on the SPL application process, see the line manager and employee \u201cHow to guides\u201d and checklists, Frequently Asked Questions and Glossary.\n\n  2. Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) also have guidance on SPL.\n\n  3. Any enquiry about the content of this instruction, or request for advice about the application of the procedures to particular circumstances, should be referred directly to the HR team.\n\n\n\n\n### Additional documents\n\n[Shared Parental Leave policy and procedure: Annex 1 - flowchart to show overview of eligibility](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5bae2715e5274a3e0d7af9c9/MHRA-Shared-Parental-Leave-Policy-Procedure-Annex-1.pdf) (PDF, 210 KB, 2 pages)\n  *[PDF]: Portable Document Format",

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so here's the deal about the maternity leave stuff at the Agency, right? They really want to help out employees who are having babies, which is cool or whatever. This is basically what you need to know about taking maternity leave and getting paid (which, honestly, is a big deal). If you're eligible, you can pick between what the Agency gives you and what the law says you can have. Just remember, you can't grab both, only one. \n\nThe maternity leave thing applies to all pregnant employees, so if you're a contractor or not directly on payroll, you're outta luck and gotta check with your own employer. Once you find out you're pregnant, which trust me, you probably know by then, you gotta tell your boss and HR like at least 15 weeks before you pop. And make sure they know stuff like when you're due and when you plan to leave work. If anything changes, like you wanna come back early, you've gotta give them at least 28 days of notice -- that's a month!  \n\nNow, health and safety? Important. The Agency has to make sure you're safe while pregnant, so there's gonna be some risk assessment nonsense. If your job\u2019s risky, they\u2019ll try to change things around and make it safe for ya and if that doesn\u2019t fly, they might even put you on leave until it\u2019s all good. You keep getting paid though!\n\nSo, about the money, for the first 26 weeks, you get full pay and then for another 13 weeks, it goes down to what's called Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP). But to score that sweet pay, you gotta say you\u2019re coming back, otherwise you\u2019ll have to pay the Agency back for what they gave you!\n\nIf you don\u2019t qualify for the paid leave, don\u2019t stress too much, you can still take a whopping 52 weeks off but it won\u2019t be paid. That\u2019s kinda rough, but hey, you can chill at home. And while we're at it, maternity leave doesn't count as sick leave but yeah, it still counts for your pension like it\u2019s a normal paycheck. So don\u2019t worry about that part!\n\nNow onto the nitty-gritty of SMP. You need to have been working for the Agency for like 26 weeks straight before you hit the 15 weeks before your baby\u2019s due. If you\u2019re wondering if you\u2019re eligible, check your pay. You need to make at least a certain amount per week, and then everything gets sorted out once you fill in your paperwork. If anything goes sideways with your pregnancy, like if it ends before the baby\u2019s born, there are some other rules.\n\nAfter going through the whole maternity circus, returning to work is also a thing. You can come back after 52 weeks but really, just let them know 28 days in advance. Also, while on maternity leave, your job is kinda safe, unless there\u2019s a layoff situation, in which that\u2019s just totally different rules. \n\nAnd if you need time to do stuff like go to doctor's appointments? Just talk to your line manager and they should hook you up with some time off. It\u2019s all about keeping your rights protected and stuff, so if you feel like you\u2019re being treated unfairly, make some noise!\n\nPaternity leave is also a thing if you\u2019re wondering! Partners can get time off too, but they have different rules \u2013 usually two weeks after the baby\u2019s born.\n\nSo yeah, that\u2019s the quick rundown. It all sounds a bit complicated but just keep talking to HR and your boss. They\u2019ll help you navigate this baby-making journey at work!",

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so the Department for Work and Pensions, or DWP for short, can help you out if you got some kinda disability or health problem that makes it hard to do stuff like... uh... using the phone or the internet, reading letters, filling out forms, going to meetings, or understanding complicated stuff about managing your own things. \\n\\n### Having Trouble with the Phone\\nSo if you can\u2019t really use the phone, don\u2019t worry! There are ways around it! You can try Relay UK, it\u2019s this service that BT does for folks who can\u2019t hear or talk as well. You can talk to them about benefits and pensions and all that important stuff you need.\\n\\nThen there's Textphone, it's kinda like a phone for people who can\u2019t talk directly, and you can find the numbers in some guides, pretty standard stuff. Then there's this Video Relay Service if you\u2019re using British Sign Language, which is neat because you can chat with a translator and get your DWP stuff sorted too.  Just check out the contact info to see how to use that thing.\\n\\nIf those don\u2019t help, you can ask them to talk through email (just make sure to say it\u2019s 'cause of your health thing), get a friend or family member to help out (just let them know it\u2019s cool), or even schedule a home visit which is kinda nice too. \\n\\n### Computer Issues\\nSo if the online stuff isn\u2019t working for you, just give them a call or shoot them a letter and tell them it\u2019s because you can\u2019t use the digital services with your condition. They\u2019ll help you figure it out!\n\\n### Reading or Form Trouble\\nIf reading letters or filling out forms is tough, let \u2018em know when you reach out. You could ask for stuff like bigger fonts or Braille if you need it. There\u2019s also audio options, like getting stuff on CD or as MP3s which is cool for listening. If you\u2019re into using tech, they can email you things that you can read better, or they can call you to explain stuff in detail too!\\nAnd if colors mess with your reading, you can ask for different color papers, that\u2019s allowed! \\n\\n### Meetings\\nNow, about those face-to-face meetings... If you gotta go to an office but it\u2019s too much 'cause of your health, you can ask for things like quieter times for appointments, or maybe use a different area in a job center that\u2019s not so busy, you know? Plus, bring someone you trust or get someone to meet you when you get there. It should be easier than just showing up and being overwhelmed. \\n\\nIf you can\u2019t go to the office at all, you can still ask for a home visit too, so that's nice.\\n\\n### Managing Your Affairs\\nIf it's all too much and you can't manage things, you can get someone to be your appointee, which means they'll do things for you. Super helpful!\\n\\n### Complaints\\nAnd hey, if you feel like things aren\u2019t working out or the service isn\u2019t accessible, you can totally complain about it. Just hit up their complaints section online. \\n\\nSo yeah, that\u2019s the gist of it all with the DWP and how they can help! Pretty handy if you ask me.",

It\u2019s managed by something called the Education and Skills Funding Agency, which is part of the government, or the Department for Education, or however you wanna call it.\n\nIn your PLR, you can find all sorts of qualifications\u2014like, it covers general stuff and vocational stuff. You'll see things like QCF, A levels, GCSEs, BTECs, Diplomas, and these things called Functional Skills. It\u2019s pretty much everything you've done since 2012 if you're in England, but for Wales, it\u2019s since 2014 and Northern Ireland since 2015. So, uh, not everything goes back forever, you know?\n\nIf you wanna get a look at your personal learning record, just hit up your learning provider first. They should be able to help. But, like, it might take up to a month for them to email you back. If they can\u2019t help, you can download this request form and send it back via email, but you gotta include proof that it\u2019s really you. \n\nPlus, don\u2019t forget that, uh, your PLR only shows qualifications that Ofqual regulates and stuff. So if you got some training that wasn\u2019t funded by the ESFA, it might not show up. Just keep that in mind because, yeah, that would be lame if you\u2019re counting on it appearing and it doesn\u2019t.\n\nOh, and there was this National Careers Service website thing where you could check your PLR too, but that shut down in October 2016. So no more of that, I guess. \n\nIf you find a problem with your PLR, like, if it has the wrong info about your qualifications, you can report that. But, don't expect ESFA to help find missing qualifications\u2014it\u2019s like, not their job or something. If you\u2019re part of a school or college, just ask them to handle it through this portal thingy for data issues. If you\u2019re not in school or anything, you can call this number 0345 602 2589 for help.\n\nNow, there\u2019s this unique learner number too, called ULN. It\u2019s a 10-digit number, and most kids aged 14 and up have one. It\u2019s used with your PLR to keep track of your learning and achievements. The ESFA needs this ULN to manage data, so it\u2019s a pretty big deal. To see what they do with your data, check out the privacy notices because they\u2019re important or whatever. \n\nIf you wanna find your ULN, and you're in that 14 to 19 age group, just ask your school or college for it. They can tell you what it is! Some certificates even have the ULN printed on them since 2013. Pretty neat, right? Anyway, that\u2019s about it with your PLR and ULN stuff!",

You can find guidance on [working out 80% of your employees wages through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/work-out-80-of-your-employees-wages-to-claim-through-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme).\n\nYou should also consider payments the employee was due to receive in the relevant period that would have been classed as earnings. This could include:\n\n  * bonus payments\n  * commission payments\n\n\n\nNo changes to how you work out their AWE will be needed where:\n\n  * you claimed the employee\u2019s wages through the scheme but you topped them up to full pay at your own cost \u2014 the employee\u2019s earnings were not lower than they would have been\n  * as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, during the relevant period you agreed a reduction in pay with your employee outside of the scheme\n\n\n\n## Employee earnings affected by a pay rise\n\nA pay rise must not be withheld because of maternity leave.\n\nYou must recalculate the average weekly earnings (AWE) to take account of pay rises awarded, or that would have been awarded had your employee not been on maternity leave.\n\nThis applies if the pay rise was effective from anytime between the start of the 8 week relevant period for Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) and the end of the statutory maternity leave.\n\nIf a pay rise is awarded after you\u2019ve calculated your employee\u2019s earnings, and that pay rise is effective from the start date of the relevant period but before the end of the statutory maternity leave, you must:\n\n  * recalculate the AWE to include the pay rise as though it was effective from the beginning of the relevant period\n  * pay any extra SMP due\n\n\n\nIf a pay rise is awarded which, when recalculated, means that earnings are now high enough for your employee to get SMP when they could not before, you must:\n\n  1. Work out 90% of the AWE.\n  2. Take away the standard rate of SMP.\n  3. Pay the difference for 6 weeks.\n\n\n\nIf 90% of the AWE is less than the standard rate you might not have to pay your employee anything.\n\nThis is because they may have received the balance of SMP due from Jobcentre Plus (or the Jobs and Benefits office in Northern Ireland) as Maternity Allowance (MA).\n\nNot all women are entitled to MA, or the MA may be less than the SMP your employee is now entitled to. You should ask them to get a letter from the Jobcentre Plus (or the Jobs and Benefits office in Northern Ireland) to confirm how much MA was received.\n\nIf your employee gives you a letter from the Jobcentre Plus office (or the Jobs and Benefits office in Northern Ireland) showing how much MA was received:\n\n  1. Work out the total amount of SMP they\u2019re entitled to.\n  2. Take away the MA that was paid.\n  3. Take away any SMP you\u2019ve already paid.\n  4. Pay your employee the difference.\n\n\n\nYour employee should still benefit from a pay rise, even if they do not intend to return to work with you after their maternity leave has ended.\n\nIf a pay award is made after they have terminated their employment and the pay rise is backdated to when they were working for you, or were on maternity leave with you, they may be entitled to benefit from the pay rise. You must check the terms of their old contract of employment.\n\nIf more than one pay rise has been awarded during the period they were on maternity leave you\u2019ll need to make separate calculations for each one.\n\n## Underpayments and overpayments\n\nIf there are over or underpaid earnings affecting the AWE which disadvantages either you or the employee, check if there\u2019s documentary evidence agreeing to the amount that should have been paid.\n\nIf there is use the agreed earnings to calculate the AWE.\n\nIf there is not use the actual earnings.\n\n## Employee becomes sick\n\nIf the employee:\n\n  * becomes [sick during the SMP pay period](https://www.gov.uk/statutory-sick-pay-employee-circumstances-that-affect-payment#emp-preg) do not pay Statutory Sick Pay (SSP), continue to pay SMP as normal\n  * returns to work within the Maternity Pay Period (MPP) and then goes sick during that period, pay SMP, not SSP\n\n\n\n## \u2018Keeping in touch\u2019 days\n\nTo keep in touch during maternity leave and ease your employee\u2019s return to work, they can work for you during their maternity leave for up to 10 days. This will not end their maternity leave or mean they lose their SMP for any weeks that they do some work.\n\nThese 10 days are called \u2018keeping in touch\u2019 (KIT) days and allow your employee to undertake training or do occasional work for you.\n\nThe employer has no right to demand that KIT work is undertaken and an employee does not have to do it. Before any work is done, you must agree with your employee:\n\n  * what work they\u2019ll be doing\n  * whether the KIT days are used in a row, one at a time or in blocks \u2014 any work on any day (even an hour) will count as a whole KIT day\n  * how much they\u2019ll be paid for the work they do\n\n\n\nYou may count the amount of SMP towards the contractual pay agreed with your employee, but you must pay the weekly SMP rate the employee is entitled to and comply with your statutory obligations (for example, paying at least the National Minimum Wage).\n\nIf your employee works more than 10 days for you in their SMP pay period:\n\n  * you cannot pay SMP to them for any weeks where they work\n  * their maternity leave will come to an end\n\n\n\nOnce your employee has used their 10 KIT days, they\u2019ll lose one week\u2019s SMP for each week or part week they work for you.\n\nThe SMP pay period is not extended to take account of these weeks. Any SMP lost in this way is always at the standard rate first, or 90% of the AWE if this is lower than the standard rate.\n\nAn employee must take 2 weeks \u2014 or 4 weeks if working in a factory \u2014 compulsory maternity leave immediately after the date the child is born, and cannot work or use a KIT day during that time.\n\n## Employee returns to work then goes off sick\n\nWhere your employee has returned to work within their MPP and goes off sick they cannot get SSP from you. You should consider paying SMP.\n\n## Employee leaves job\n\nYour employee cannot get maternity leave if they have left their job, but they may still qualify for SMP.\n\nIt does not matter why they left or that they\u2019re not coming back \u2014 they\u2019re entitled to SMP if they satisfy the qualifying conditions, you cannot ask them to repay it.\n\nThere are special rules for when you start to pay. Work out the date of the Sunday of the 11th week before the week the baby is due.\n\nIf they leave your employment before that date, the SMP pay period will start on the earlier of the following dates:\n\n  * the Sunday of the 11th week before the baby is due\n  * the day after the baby is born\n\n\n\nIf they leave their employment after the start of the 11th week, and before any other event which may trigger their pay, then the pay period starts the day following the day on which they left their employment.\n\n## Employee works for another employer\n\nIt\u2019s up to your employee to tell you that they\u2019re working for another employer and when they stop working for that employer.\n\n### Employee starts work with another employer before or during the qualifying week (QW)\n\nIf your employee started work for another employer before the end of the QW you must continue to pay SMP throughout the MPP, even if they\u2019re still working for that employer after the baby is born, unless one of the following apply:\n\n#### Employee starts work with another employer after the QW and before the baby is born\n\nIf your employee starts work for another employer after the QW, but before the birth of the child you do not have to pay SMP for any weeks they work for that employer after the baby is born.\n\nYou must reinstate SMP for any full maternity weeks your employee does not work for that employer after the baby is born.\n\nIf your employee\u2019s contract with that employer ends during the MPP, their entitlement to SMP will restart until the end of the MPP.\n\n#### Employee starts work for another employer after the baby is born\n\nIf your employee starts work for another employer after the baby is born, you do not have to pay SMP for any weeks they work for that employer.\n\nYou must pay SMP for any full maternity weeks your employee does not work for that employer.\n\nIf your employee\u2019s contract with that employer ends during the MPP, entitlement to SMP also ends and cannot be restarted.\n\nYou must issue your employee with [form SMP1](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statutory-maternity-pay-employee-not-entitled-form-for-employers).\n\n## Employee taken into legal custody\n\nYou cannot pay SMP for any SMP pay week your employee is in legal custody (this usually means they\u2019re in prison) or for any week in the pay period after that.\n\nYou must give the employee [form SMP1](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statutory-maternity-pay-employee-not-entitled-form-for-employers) within 7 days of the decision being made. This must be done within 28 days from the date the employee gave notice of absence (or the date they gave birth if this had occurred earlier).\n\nIt\u2019s your employee\u2019s responsibility to tell you if they\u2019re detained in legal custody.\n\nThey are not in legal custody if they\u2019re:\n\n  * voluntarily helping police with their enquiries\n  * out on bail\n  * serving a suspended sentence\n\n\n\n## Employee dies\n\nIf your employee dies during the MPP, you should pay SMP for the week in which they die, but not for any week in the MPP after that.\n\n## Baby dies\n\nIf the baby dies during the SMP pay period, payment should continue as normal.\n\n## Stillbirth\n\nYour employee is entitled to SMP and maternity leave if the baby is stillborn.\n\nA stillbirth occurs if the baby is stillborn after the 24th week of pregnancy.\n\nYou\u2019ll need evidence before making payment (for example, a stillbirth certificate issued by the registrar, or a certificate or notification for the registration of a stillbirth issued by the attending midwife or doctor).\n\nIf a baby is born alive but survives only for an instant, this is a live birth and you must apply the rules for a live birth.\n\n## Break in employment\n\nSome breaks between periods of employment will not interrupt a period of continuous employment for SMP purposes. Employees with an ongoing contract of service during the following breaks remain continuously employed:\n\n  * temporary cessation of work \u2014 including short-term contract or agency workers\n  * public holidays\n  * sickness or injury \u2014 the employee can get SMP if the total period of incapacity is 26 weeks or less\n  * paternity, parental and adoption leave \u2014 if the employee took paternity leave when they were adopting a child, or when a baby was born and they worked for you before and after the break\n  * pregnancy \u2014 if your employee was not working for you because of a birth, and they worked for you before and after the break, and the break is not more than 26 weeks\n\n\n\n## Non-cash payments and contractual benefits\n\nYou may normally pay some of your employee\u2019s earnings as a non-cash payment (for example, providing board and lodging or giving them goods or services).\n\nHowever, you must pay any SMP in full. SMP cannot be sacrificed or offset against other benefits, it must be paid in cash.\n\nAll non-pay contractual benefits must continue during statutory maternity leave. These may include any childcare vouchers, company car or mobile phone provided to the employee as part of their contract of employment.\n\n## Lump sums\n\nIf you decide to pay the SMP as a lump sum, you and your employee could pay more National Insurance contributions (NICs) than if you paid it on their normal payday.\n\n## Reinstatement after dismissal\n\nIf your employee did not work for you during the relevant period because you dismissed them, they\u2019re entitled to SMP as if they had not been dismissed, if:\n\n  * they\u2019re reinstated because an employment tribunal decides that you dismissed them unfairly\n  * you reinstate them as a result of a statutory grievance procedure\n\n\n\n## Reinstatement after armed forces service\n\nIf the employee did not work for you during the relevant period because they were serving in the armed forces, but they returned to work for you within 6 months of the end of their service in the forces they may still be able to get SMP.\n\nThe employee must have been continuously employed by you for at least 26 weeks by the end of the QW to get SMP.\n\nThe period they served in the armed forces does not count as part of the 26 weeks.\n\nThe period they were employed with you before and after their service in the armed forces will count.\n\n## Trade disputes or industrial action\n\nYour employee must have been continuously employed by you for at least 26 weeks by the end of the QW. Do not count the period they were on strike (even if this was one day) as this week will not count as part of the 26 weeks.\n\nYour employee must have been employed for 26 weeks from the start of their employment into the QW.\n\n## Premature or early birth after QW\n\nIf the baby is born early, there are special rules for when your employee needs to give you evidence and when you start to pay. All the other terms and conditions apply.\n\nYour employee will not have been able to give you advance notice, but they must tell you the date of birth as soon as possible.\n\nYour employee should give you medical evidence (usually a form MATB1 maternity certificate) of the date the baby was due and the date of birth. You can accept a birth certificate as evidence of the date of birth.\n\nYour employee should give you the evidence within 21 days after the date of birth, or as soon as they can if that\u2019s not possible, and no later than 13 weeks after the start of the SMP pay period.\n\nThe maternity leave and SMP pay period starts on the day after the date of birth.\n\n## Baby born in or before the QW\n\nIf the baby is born in or before the QW, there are special rules. The employee must:\n\n  * give you medical evidence of the date the baby is due\n  * have been continuously employed by you for 26 weeks\n  * have AWE high enough in the [relevant period](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/statutory-maternity-pay-manually-calculate-your-employees-payments#terminology-explained)\n  * give you acceptable notice for start of SMP\n\n\n\nYour employee should give you medical evidence (usually a form MATB1 maternity certificate) of the date the baby was expected to be born as well as the actual date of birth.\n\nYou can accept any document signed by a doctor or midwife as long as an expected date of birth is provided.\n\nYou can accept a birth certificate as evidence of the date of birth, but this is not accepted as evidence of the date the baby is due.\n\nYour employee should give you the evidence within 21 days of the start of their SMP pay period, or as soon as they can, but no later than 13 weeks after the start of the SMP pay period.\n\nIf the baby is born before or during the QW, the continuous employment rule is satisfied as if they would have completed 26 weeks continuous employment with you if the baby had not been born early.\n\nYou must work out the AWE in the [relevant period](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/statutory-maternity-pay-manually-calculate-your-employees-payments) by using the birth date instead of the QW.\n\n## Pregnancy-related absence\n\nIf the employee is absent from work because of their pregnancy and the absence continues into or starts within the 4 week period starting on the Sunday of the 4th week before the week baby due, there are special rules for when leave starts and when you start to pay.\n\nThe SMP pay period and their maternity leave start on the day after the first complete day of absence from work because of their pregnancy within the 4 week period. This may mean that you have to pay a mixture of wages and SMP at the beginning or end of the period.\n\nIf you are not sure whether the employee\u2019s absence is caused by their pregnancy contact the [Employer Helpline](https://www.gov.uk/contact/hm-revenue-customs/employer-enquiries) for advice.\n\n## Employee does not qualify for SMP: PAYE Settlement Agreements\n\nYou must recalculate your employee\u2019s AWE if all of the following apply:\n\n  * their AWE are less than the lower earnings limit in force at the end of the QW\n  * they received any expense payments or benefits in kind in the relevant period\n  * the expenses or benefits were included in a [Pay As You Earn (PAYE) Settlement Agreement](https://www.gov.uk/paye-settlement-agreements)\n\n\n\nYou must recalculate their AWE if you had to recalculate your employee\u2019s earnings because they did not qualify and both the following apply:\n\n  * some of their earnings were included in a [PAYE Settlement Agreement](https://www.gov.uk/paye-settlement-agreements)\n  * they get a backdated pay rise that\u2019s effective during or before the start of the relevant period which you had not included in the original calculation\n\n\n\nIf they do not intend to return to work after the birth they may still be entitled to benefit from the pay rise. You must check the terms of their old contract of employment.\n\n## Salary sacrifice\n\nIf an employee has entered into a [salary sacrifice](https://www.gov.uk/salary-sacrifice-and-the-effects-on-paye) their AWE is calculated using the amount of earnings actually paid to them during the relevant period. SMP cannot be sacrificed, it must be paid in full.\n\nTo calculate AWE for SMP, base the calculation on earnings subject to NICs. See [expenses and benefits](https://www.gov.uk/expenses-and-benefits-a-to-z) for more information.\n\nSome schemes for childcare support provided by you and made available to your employees may be exempt from PAYE tax and Class 1 NICs.\n\nThe value of the childcare vouchers provided during the MPP cannot be deducted from the SMP.\n\nWhere an employee agrees to accept [childcare vouchers](https://www.gov.uk/expenses-and-benefits-childcare) as part of a salary sacrifice their SMP entitlement will be assessed on their gross earnings on which NICs are payable.\n\n  1. Work out the total amount they\u2019re now entitled to.\n  2. Take away any SMP you\u2019ve already paid.\n  3. Pay any extra SMP due.\n\n\n\nIf the new AWE are less than the lower earnings limit they cannot get SMP.\n\nIf you have not already done so, give the employee [form SMP1](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statutory-maternity-pay-employee-not-entitled-form-for-employers) within 7 days of the decision being made.\n\nThis must be done within 28 days from the date the employee gave notice of absence (or the date they gave birth if this had occurred earlier).\n\nTake a copy of the form MATB1 maternity certificate, and give the original back to your employee.\n  *[CJRS]: Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme\n  *[AWE]: Average Weekly Earnings\n  *[SMP]: Statutory Maternity Pay\n  *[MA]: Maternity Allowance\n  *[SSP]: Statutory Sick Pay\n  *[MPP]: Maternity Pay Period\n  *[KIT]: Keeping In Touch\n  *[QW]: Qualifying Week\n  *[NICs]: National Insurance contributions\n  *[PAYE]: Pay As You Earn",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, like, if you have employees that were on furlough 'cause of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (or CJRS for short), there are some rules to follow about their pay starting from April 25, 2020. Basically, if these employees got some help and were paid during an 8-week stretch, you gotta figure their Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) differently. This is mainly to not mess with their Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) when their pay was, like, lower because of furlough. \n\nSo, to calculate AWE for the months they were on furlough, you take the higher amount of what they actually got paid or what they would have earned if they weren't on furlough. If you\u2019re a bit confused about what they\u2019d have made, you can start with the reference salary you used to figure out any claims.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t forget to include any bonuses or commission that they should have gotten during that time when working out their AWE. If you\u2019ve claimed wages under the scheme but kept paying them to full pay yourself, then there\u2019s no need to adjust their AWE because they were making the same amount. \n\nNow, about pay raises: if an employee is on maternity leave and they get a pay increase, you can\u2019t hold that back. You have to recalculate their AWE to include this raise, it doesn\u2019t matter when during their leave it happens. If raises happen while you're doing their calculations, you have to assume it was effective from the start of the relevant period, and pay them any extra SMP that comes from that.\n\nIf, after recalculating, the AWE means they can get SMP when they couldn\u2019t before, you need to do a little math. Work out 90% of their AWE, subtract the standard SMP rate, and that\u2019s what you pay them for 6 weeks. If that 90% is lower than the standard rate, well, you might not have to pay them much at all. Sometimes, they might even get Maternity Allowance instead, but not every woman qualifies for that, so make sure to get proof of what they received from Jobcentre Plus or whatever that office is called.\n\nIf your employee decides to work on keeping in touch days (they can do 10 of those during maternity leave), this won\u2019t mess with their SMP. Just make sure to agree beforehand what they\u2019ll do and how they\u2019ll be paid and all that stuff. But a heads up, if they work more than those 10 days, you can\u2019t pay them SMP for the weeks they actually work.\n\nIf the employee leaves before baby birth but after the 11th week, they could still get SMP, as long as they meet the criteria. And, if they\u2019re working somewhere else, you just have to honor their SMP if they were on leave before they started the other job. \n\nSometimes, if they were in legal trouble (like jail) or if they die, that changes things with SMP too. The rules say you should keep paying for certain cases like that, but you'll have to look at the rules more closely. \n\nAnd forget it if they were pregnant and then took time off \u2014 that matters too. So, it\u2019s a lot of rules about when you gotta pay or not pay, how raises affect SMP, and all that jazz. Just remember if it gets confusing, go check the official info to sort things out!",

If you have to deduct PAYE tax and Class 1 National Insurance contributions from the worker\u2019s earnings, then you will have to pay them SPP if they satisfy all the qualifying conditions.\n\n## Supply teachers, seasonal workers or other sporadic employment\n\nGenerally the same rules apply as for agency workers, but if they are:\n\n  * sick throughout the Matching week (MW) (adoption) or Qualifying Week (QW) (birth)\n  * not required to work during those weeks\n\n\n\nthey can be treated as having worked in the MW (adoption) or QW (birth).\n\nThis applies even if they do not resume work before commencing paternity absence.\n\n## Mariners\n\nMariners can get SPP if you have a place of business in the UK and they are on a home-trade ship.\n\n## NHS employees\n\nSome NHS employees, whose contracts are split between Strategic Health Authorities and NHS Trusts as a result of NHS reorganisation, can choose to have all their earnings added together for working out Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) for SPP purposes.\n\n## Employee works abroad\n\nWhere your employee works for you outside the UK:\n\n  * from the latest start date for employment with you\n  * up to and including the Sunday of the QW or MW\n\n\n\nand continues to work for you until the baby is born or the child is placed for adoption they can get SPP if you are liable to pay Class 1 National Insurance contributions on their earnings throughout the period or you would have been liable to pay Class 1 National Insurance contributions had their earnings been high enough.\n\nHowever, if you aren\u2019t liable to pay Class 1 National Insurance contributions, your employee may still be able to get SPP where your employee works for you within the European Economic Area (EEA):\n\n  * from the latest start date for employment with you\n  * up to and including the Sunday of the QW or MW\n\n\n\nand continues to work for you until the baby is born or the child is placed for adoption if they worked for you in the QW or MW and you were liable to pay Class 1 National Insurance contributions on their earnings for that week.\n\nFor SPP your employee must continue working for you until the end of the week before they want their SPP to start.\n\nFor the period after the QW or MW the employment can be in either the UK or EEA.\n\n## Directors\n\n### Companies incorporated after 1 October 2009\n\nThere are new regulations for companies incorporated after 1 October 2009. They provide new Articles of Association for these companies and will:\n\n  * apply by default if other Articles are not adopted\n  * allow its directors to determine a director\u2019s remuneration\n\n\n\nDirectors can decide what and when to pay remuneration. There is no need for a resolution of the companies shareholders at its Annual General Meeting (AGM). In such cases payment of director\u2019s fees will be regarded as earnings for the purpose of entitlement to SPP on the date payment was made.\n\n### Companies incorporated before 1 October 2009\n\nThe previous standard Articles, which apply in default, continue to apply. An ordinary resolution is required to determine director\u2019s remuneration. The method of calculating director\u2019s remuneration by an annual figure (after an ordinary resolution has been passed by shareholders) will apply to these companies. Any payments made in anticipation of the annual vote cannot be taken into account for calculating Average Weekly Earnings (AWE).\n\n#### Paid contractually\n\nIf the director is contractually paid a regular salary - their AWE are calculated like any other employee.\n\n#### Paid by a determination of the directors (not a formal vote)\n\nCalculate the AWE by adding together the monies paid and any other payments of earnings, but use the date monies were paid instead of the date of the shareholders\u2019 resolution at the AGM to determine the total earnings during the relevant period.\n\n#### Paid both contractually and by formal vote\n\nA director who is paid contractually may also be paid a bonus or fees by a formal vote. You must still calculate their AWE like any other employee, but you should only include the monies voted by formal vote if the date of the vote falls in the relevant period.\n\n#### Paid only by a formal vote\n\nIf the director is paid only by a formal vote calculate their AWE in the usual way, substituting the dates of the formal votes in place of the normal paydays. A formal vote usually takes place at the company\u2019s AGM and is agreed in the company minutes.\n\n#### Monies drawn in anticipation of a formal vote\n\nSome directors may regularly draw money from the business in anticipation of a formal vote. Do not include this money when working out the director\u2019s AWE, even if National Insurance contributions were deducted at the time they were paid.\n\n## Your employee has more than one job with you\n\nYour employee could have more than one job with you.\n\nIf you:\n\n  * add all the employee\u2019s earnings together to work out Class 1 National Insurance contributions you would do the same to work out the employee\u2019s AWE and the employee can only get one lot of SPP\n  * work out Class 1 National Insurance contributions separately on the employee\u2019s earnings then you must work out their AWE separately and the employee can get more than one lot of SPP\n\n\n\nIf they can only get one payment of SPP from you they should take the same time off from each job otherwise they will lose some of their SPP because they are working for you. If they are entitled to more than one payment of SPP from you they can choose to take different time off from each job without losing their entitlement to SPP.\n\n## Employee has more than one employer\n\nIf your employee has more than one employer they can get SPP from each employer if they satisfy all the qualifying conditions. They can choose to take different time off from each employer.\n  *[MW]: Matching week\n  *[QW]: Qualifying Week\n  *[AWE]: Average Weekly Earnings\n  *[EEA]: European Economic Area\n  *[AGM]: Annual General Meeting",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, like, agency workers are treated kinda like regular employees when it comes to tax stuff, you know? If you gotta take money out for PAYE tax and National Insurance from what they earn, they may be eligible for this thing called Statutory Paternity Pay (SPP) if they meet certain requirements, which is super important for them. Even if you have no work for them or they can't work because they\u2019re sick or on maternity leave, they might still get SPP. \n\nThen, there are agricultural workers. So, the thing is, this Agricultural Wages Board got dissolved back in October 2013. Since that happened, any agricultural workers not under the board's rules can also get Statutory Payments if they fit the criteria. \n\nNow, casual employees are basically those who just kinda show up to work whenever, usually on short contracts. If you\u2019re taking out PAYE and National Insurance from their pay, they should also receive SPP if they meet the qualifying conditions, whatever those might be!\n\nSupply teachers and seasonal workers, yeah, same rules as agency workers. But if they\u2019re sick during the weeks they\u2019d usually work for a new baby (like in the Matching week or Qualifying week), they can still count that as being employed during those weeks, which is good for SPP eligibility!  \n\nAnd then there's mariners! They can get SPP if you\u2019re running a business in the UK and they\u2019re on a home-trade ship. Pretty straightforward! \n\nFor NHS staff, if they have contracts split between different health authorities, they can add their pay together to figure out their Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) for SPP stuff. \n\nNow, if your employee works abroad, they can still qualify for SPP if they\u2019ve been working for you from the latest start date until the baby\u2019s born or they\u2019ve finalized an adoption, as long as you\u2019re paying the right National Insurance stuff. \n\nMoving on to directors, there\u2019s a different thing for companies that started after October 2009. They get these new rules that mean the directors can basically decide how much they pay themselves without needing shareholder approval right at the AGM, which is kinda nice for them, I guess. Directors' fees count as earnings for SPP based on when they\u2019re actually paid. \n\nFor companies that started before October 2009, they still need a shareholder vote to figure out pay. This basically means they calculate AWE on the amount agreed at a vote. \n\nAnd if a director is paid regularly, it's like any other employee; you just calculate AWE the same way. If they get paid some other way, you have to mix that in differently, and if they\u2019re waiting for votes to get paid, you can't count that when figuring their AWE. \n\nThen we got employees who might work multiple jobs with you. If you add all their earnings to calculate National Insurance, do the same for their AWE, but they can only get SPP once. If you calculate things separately, then they can get more SPP since the earnings are separated, which is good, right? They should take the same time off or they could lose some SPP. \n\nFinally, if someone has multiple jobs, they can get SPP from each of them if they meet the conditions. They can take different time off from each job too, which is actually pretty cool.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s all you need to know, or at least most of it!",

But just before that week, if she\u2019s no longer linked to the old employer, tough luck, no SMP but sure, she can still take leave, no worries there.\n\nWhen SMP isn\u2019t a thing, you gotta fill out some form (SMP1) and get it done in 7 days \u2013 make sure that happens within 28 days from the notice of absence or if she pops the baby out earlier, just keep track of that!\n\nNow, if you, say, shut down your business, you still gotta handle those SMP payments until the employee's got everything they\u2019re entitled to or something else happens, like they quit or whatever.\n\nAnd if you go insolvent, which is, like, really bad news, then after the Qualifying Week starts and before pay kicks in, HMRC\u2019s got your back and will cover that SMP. During the pay week, they take over from when you went insolvent which is nice of them, right? Just make sure to tell HMRC that you're in a heap of trouble! \n\nIf your employee totally loses their job but has already qualified for SMP, you\u2019re still responsible to pay it even if they go bye-bye for any reason, even redundancy. But if she finds another job after the baby\u2019s out and it\u2019s with a different employer who didn\u2019t employ her during QW, no more SMP.  Oh, and there are some special rules about letting pregnant ladies go during this time, so definitely reach out to Acas for those deets.",

Your employee receives this after the 20th week of pregnancy and it includes the date the baby is due.\n\n### Qualifying week\n\nThe qualifying week is the 15th week (Sunday to Saturday) before the week the baby is due.\n\n## Before you begin\n\nInformation you need to work out your employee\u2019s Statutory Maternity Pay:\n\n  * the date the baby\u2019s due \u2014 from your employee\u2019s MATB1 form\n  * your employee\u2019s intended start date for Statutory Maternity Pay, if they have given you one\n  * your employee\u2019s gross pay and the dates they were paid\n  * confirmation that your employee\u2019s gross earnings are liable to employer\u2019s Class 1 National Insurance contributions or would be but for the employee\u2019s age or level of earnings\n\n\n\n## Work out average weekly earnings\n\nAverage weekly earnings must include all earnings on which Class 1 National Insurance contributions are due, or would be due if they were high enough. Statutory Maternity Pay entitlement depends on your employee\u2019s average weekly earnings in the \u2018relevant period\u2019. The average weekly earnings in the relevant period must not be less than the Lower Earnings Limit for National Insurance contributions which applies at the end of the qualifying week:\n\n  * Lower Earnings Limit for 2024 to 2025 is \u00a3123\n\n\n\nDivide all earnings paid in that relevant period by the number of days, weeks or months in that period.\n\n### The relevant period\n\nThis is usually the 8 week period before the qualifying week.\n\nThe end of the relevant period is the last normal payday on, or before the Saturday of the qualifying week.\n\nFor babies born before or during the qualifying week, the 8 week relevant period is the period between the last normal payday on or before the Saturday of the week before the baby is born, and the day after the last normal payday falling at least 8 weeks before.\n\nThe start of the relevant period is the day after the last normal payday falling at least 8 weeks before the end of the relevant period.\n\n#### Example for an employee who is paid weekly\n\nIf an employee is paid weekly and the baby is due on 23 March 2025:\n\nQualifying week | Payday | Last payday at least 8 weeks before the end of the relevant period | Last payday on or before the Saturday of the qualifying week  \n---|---|---|---  \n1 December 2024 to 6 December 2024 | Friday | 11 October 2024 | 6 December 2024  \n  \nThe relevant period is 12 October 2024 to 6 December 2024.\n\nAdd up all the earnings paid between 12 October 2024 to 6 December 2024 and divide by 8 (the number of weeks in the relevant period).\n\nDo not round the figure up or down to whole pence.\n\n#### Example for an employee who is paid monthly\n\nIf an employee is paid monthly and the baby is due on 23 March 2025:\n\nQualifying week | Payday | Last payday at least 8 weeks before the end of the relevant period | Last payday on or before the Saturday of the qualifying week  \n---|---|---|---  \n1 December 2024 to 6 December 2024 | Last working day of the month | 30 September 2024 | 29 November 2024  \n  \nThe relevant period is 30 October 2024 to 30 November 2024.\n\nAdd up all the earnings paid between 1 October 2024 and 29 November 2024:\n\n  * divide by 2 (number of months in the relevant period)\n  * multiply by 12 (number of months in the year)\n  * divide by 52 (number of weeks in the year)\n\n\n\nDo not round the figure up or down to whole pence.\n\n### Weekly paid employees without a whole number of weeks in the relevant period\n\nThis may happen if you bring forward your employee\u2019s normal payday because of bank holidays at Easter or Christmas. Divide the earnings by the number of weeks wages actually paid, not the number of weeks in the relevant period.\n\n### Employees paid multiples of a week\n\nThis may happen if you pay your employee fortnightly or 4 weekly. Divide the earnings by the number of whole weeks in the relevant period.\n\n### Monthly paid employees without a whole number of months in the relevant period\n\nWork out the number of rounded months as follows:\n\n  * count the number of whole months\n  * count the numbers of odd days\n\n\n\nRound up or down as follows:\n\n  * February \u2014 14 days or less round down, 15 days or more round up\n  * any month except February \u2014 15 days or less round down, 16 days or more round up\n\n\n\nDivide the earnings by this number of rounded months.\n\n### Employees not paid in a regular pay pattern\n\nDivide the earnings by the number of days in the relevant period and multiply by 7.\n\n### Mistimed payments\n\nThis only applies to regular payments of earnings paid other than on their normal date, such as due to a bank holiday.\n\nA mistimed payment:\n\n  * occurs when the date of the actual payment of earnings is made earlier or later than the normal contractual payday, such as an annual holiday\n  * should not be confused with a payroll error, where a mistake is made in the payroll resulting in a shortfall of pay when working out the average weekly earnings\n\n\n\nDivide the total earnings in the relevant period by the number of weeks wages actually paid.\n\n### Overpaid or underpaid earnings during the relevant period\n\nAlways calculate average weekly earnings based on all earnings actually paid to the employee within the relevant period, regardless of any over or underpaid wages in that period. Where over or under payments of wages occur within the relevant period, you must include the overpaid or underpaid amount in the average weekly earnings calculation for deciding if Statutory Maternity Pay is due.\n\n## Work out Statutory Maternity Pay\n\nWhen you have worked out the average weekly earnings, work out how much Statutory Maternity Pay is due and pay it on the same day that you would normally pay wages and for the same period.\n\nStatutory Maternity Pay is a weekly payment. Statutory Maternity Pay pay weeks start with the first day of the Statutory Maternity Pay pay period, so an Statutory Maternity Pay pay period that starts on a Wednesday will have pay weeks within the pay period which runs from Wednesday to Tuesday the following week.\n\nStatutory Maternity Pay is payable:\n\n  * 90% of the employee\u2019s average weekly earnings for the first 6 weeks\n  * \u00a3184.03 or 90% of their average weekly earnings (whichever is lower) for the remaining weeks\n\n\n\n### Statutory Maternity Pay paid part weekly\n\nYou can pay Statutory Maternity Pay in part weeks if it helps to align the payments to your employees normal pay period. Divide the weekly rate by 7 and multiply by the number of days for which Statutory Maternity Pay is due in the week or month. For example, if the pay period covers the end of one month and the beginning of the next (2 days in April and 5 days at the beginning of May) then pay two-sevenths in one month and five-sevenths at the beginning of the next month.\n\n### Contractual benefits and Salary Sacrifice\n\nThe calculation of average weekly earnings for Statutory Maternity Pay is based on earnings which are subject to Class 1 National Insurance contributions. Some contractual benefits, such as [childcare schemes](https://www.gov.uk/expenses-and-benefits-childcare) provided by you, may be exempt from PAYE tax and National Insurance contributions. The value of childcare vouchers provided during the maternity pay period should not be deducted from the Statutory Maternity Pay. Statutory Maternity Pay must be paid in full.\n\n## Recovery of Statutory Maternity Pay\n\nYou may be able to [recover some or all of the Statutory Maternity Pay](https://www.gov.uk/recover-statutory-payments) you pay.\n\n## Help and advice\n\nYou can get advice from HMRC [Employer Helpline](https://www.gov.uk/contact/hm-revenue-customs/employer-enquiries).",

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so first off, there's this thing called a MATB1 Maternity Certificate, and that\u2019s basically the proof that says someone is pregnant. Employees usually get it after the 20th week of pregnancy, and it tells us when the baby is due, which is super important. \n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the qualifying week. This is, like, the 15th week before the due date of the baby. So if you're counting, that\u2019s sort of important if you want to figure out stuff like payments and when they start. \n\nBefore you start figuring out the Statutory Maternity Pay, you gotta have a few things ready: the due date from the MATB1 form, when the employee wants to start getting paid this maternity pay thing, how much they normally get before, and some confirmation that they\u2019ve been paying their National Insurance stuff \u2014 it\u2019s a lot, right? \n\nNow, calculating average weekly earnings is where it gets a bit tricky but like, it\u2019s not toooo bad. You need to add up all the pay where National Insurance would apply and make sure it\u2019s over a certain limit, which for 2024-2025, is \u00a3123. Then divide by how many weeks or whatever you have in the relevant period.  \n\nSpeaking of that relevant period, it\u2019s typically these 8 weeks before the qualifying week. Like, the last payday on or before the Saturday in the qualifying week, and all that jazz, which sounds complicated but just remember it's about the paydays leading up to the date. \n\nFor example, if someone\u2019s baby is due on March 23, 2025, the qualifying week is the first week of December in 2024. If you pay weekly, you take earnings from October 12 to December 6, add them up and divide by 8.  \n\nIf your employees get paid monthly, times a different formula, so you gotta pay extra attention there. Just add up their earnings and do some quick math. Basically, anytime they\u2019re not getting paid on the right payday or if there are some weird reasons like bank holidays messing it up, then you gotta count those too, and not just regular paydays.  \n\nAlright, moving on to Statutory Maternity Pay, which is like, this weekly payment most employees can get. For the first 6 weeks, they get 90% of their average weekly earnings. Then it kind of goes down to either 183.03 or a lower amount that\u2019s still 90%, depending on what they made before. \n\nYou can, like, pay it in parts if it makes sense with their usual payment schedule. Just break it down by days or something. And hey, some of those benefits they get provided might not even count against the maternity pay. \n\nLastly, you might be able to get some of the money back that you paid out for Statutory Maternity Pay, which can help a little. For advice, HMRC has a helpline or something where you can ask them all the nitty-gritty details. \n\nSo yeah, that\u2019s the gist! Sure is a lot to keep track of, I guess, but it\u2019s important to get it right.",

The child may have stayed with them before this date.\n\n## Before you begin\n\nInformation you need to calculate your employee\u2019s Statutory Adoption Pay:\n\n  * a copy of the matching certificate \u2014 or in the case of an adoption from abroad, a copy of the Official Notification from the relevant UK authority that they\u2019ve agreed that your employee is suitable to adopt a child from overseas\n  * the date the child\u2019s expected to be placed with your employee or to enter the UK\n  * your employee\u2019s gross pay and the dates they were paid\n  * the date your employee started working for you\n  * confirmation that your employee\u2019s gross earnings are liable to employer\u2019s Class 1 National Insurance contributions\n\n\n\n## Calculate average weekly earnings\n\nAverage weekly earnings must include all earnings on which Class 1 National Insurance contributions are due, or would be due if they were high enough. Statutory Adoption Pay entitlement depends on your employee\u2019s average weekly earnings in a \u2018relevant period\u2019. For the tax year 2024 to 2025 the average weekly earnings must be \u00a3123 or more. Divide all the earnings paid in that relevant period by the number of days, weeks or months in that period.\n\n### The relevant period\n\nThis is usually an 8 week period before the matching week.\n\nThe end of the relevant period is the last normal payday on or before the Saturday of the matching week.\n\nThe start of the relevant period is the day after the last normal payday falling at least 8 weeks before the end of the relevant period.\n\n### Example weekly paid employee\n\nThe matching date is 7 December 2024.\n\nMatching week | Payday | Last payday at least 8 weeks before the end of the relevant period | Last payday on or before the Saturday of the matching week  \n---|---|---|---  \n1 December 2024 to 6 December 2024 | Friday | 11 October 2024 | 6 December 2024  \n  \nThe relevant period is 12 October 2024 to 6 December 2024.\n\nAdd up all the earnings paid during the relevant period and divide by 8 (the number of weeks in the relevant period).\n\nDo not round the figure up or down to whole pence.\n\n### Example monthly paid employee\n\nThe matching date is 7 December 2024.\n\nMatching week | Payday | Last payday at least 8 weeks before the end of the relevant period | Last payday on or before the Saturday of the matching week  \n---|---|---|---  \n1 December 2024 to 6 December 2024 | Last day of month | 30 September 2024 | 29 November 2024  \n  \nThe relevant period is 1 October 2024 to 30 November 2024.\n\nAdd up all the earnings paid between during the relevant period and:\n\n  * divide by 2 (number of months in the relevant period)\n  * multiply by 12 (number of months in the year)\n  * divide by 52 (number of weeks in the year)\n\n\n\nDo not round the figure up or down to whole pence.\n\n### Weekly paid employees without a whole number of weeks in the relevant period\n\nThis may happen when you have to bring your employees normal payday forward because of bank holidays at Easter or Christmas. Divide the earnings by the number of week\u2019s wages actually paid, not the number of weeks in the relevant period.\n\n### Employees paid multiples of a week\n\nThis may happen if your employee is paid fortnightly or 4 weekly. Divide the earnings by the number of whole weeks in the relevant period.\n\n### Monthly paid employees without a whole number of months in the relevant period\n\nWork out the number of rounded months as follows:\n\n  * count the number of whole months\n  * count the numbers of odd days\n\n\n\nRound up or down as follows:\n\n  * February \u2014 14 days or less round down, 15 days or more round up\n  * any month except February \u2014 15 days or less round down, 16 days or more round up\n\n\n\nDivide the earnings by this number of rounded months.\n\n### Employees not paid in a regular pay pattern\n\nDivide the earnings by the number of days in the relevant period and multiply by 7.\n\n### Mistimed payments\n\nThis only applies to regular payments of earnings paid other than on their normal date, for example due to a bank holiday.\n\nA mistimed payment:\n\n  * occurs when the date of the actual payment of earnings is made earlier or later than the normal contractual payday, such as an annual holiday\n  * should not be confused with a payroll error, where a mistake is made in the payroll resulting in a shortfall of pay when working out the average weekly earnings\n\n\n\nDivide the total earnings in the relevant period by the number of weeks wages actually paid.\n\n### Overpayment/underpayment of earnings made during the relevant period\n\nAlways calculate average weekly earnings based on all earnings actually paid to the employee within the relevant period, regardless of any over or underpaid wages in that period. Where an overpayment or underpayment of wages was made within the relevant period, you must include the overpaid or underpaid amount in the average weekly earnings calculation for deciding if Statutory Adoption Pay is due.\n\n### Non-cash payments and contractual benefits\n\nYou may normally pay some of your employee\u2019s earnings as a non-cash payment, for example, providing board and lodging or giving them goods or services. However, you must pay any Statutory Adoption Pay in full. Statutory Adoption Pay cannot be sacrificed or offset against other benefits, it must be paid in cash.\n\nAll non-pay contractual benefits must continue during statutory adoption leave. These may include any childcare vouchers, company car or mobile phone provided to the employee as part of their contract of employment.\n\n## Calculate Statutory Adoption Pay\n\nWhen you have calculated the average weekly earnings, work out how much Statutory Adoption Pay is due and pay it on the same day that you would normally pay wages and for the same period.\n\nStatutory Adoption Pay is a weekly payment and the adoption pay period can start on any day of the week, usually the day after the last day your employee worked before starting their adoption leave. For example, an Statutory Adoption Pay period which starts on a Wednesday will have pay weeks within the pay period which run from Wednesday to the following Tuesday.\n\nStatutory Adoption Pay is usually paid for 39 weeks.\n\nStatutory Adoption Pay is payable at:\n\n  * 90% of the employee\u2019s average weekly earnings for the first 6 weeks\n  * \u00a3184.03 from 7 April 2024 or 90% of their average weekly earnings (whichever is lower) for the remaining weeks\n\n\n\n## Statutory Adoption Pay paid part weekly\n\nStatutory Adoption Pay can be paid as part weeks to help employers align the payments to their employees normal pay period by dividing the weekly rate by 7 and multiplying by the number of days Statutory Adoption Pay is to be paid in the week or month. For example, if the pay period covers the end of one month and the beginning of the next (2 days in April and 5 days at the beginning of May) then pay 2/7ths in one month and 5/7ths at the beginning of the next month.\n\n## Help and advice\n\nYou can get advice from HM Revenue and Customs [Employer Helpline](https://www.gov.uk/contact/hm-revenue-customs/employer-enquiries).",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, okay, this thing is about adoption stuff and how to deal with payments. First off, you know matching date? That\u2019s basically when the agency tells your worker they found a kid for them to adopt. Then there\u2019s this week thing, called matching week, which runs from Sunday to Saturday when they got that news. And when we say \"placed,\" it just means the kid is staying with your employee for good. They might\u2019ve already been living there before, which is kinda important, I guess.\n\nNow, before you dive into the calculations for something called Statutory Adoption Pay (or SAP, like the cool kids don\u2019t really call it that but whatever), you need some papers. Like, get a matching certificate or if they adopted from another country, a note saying they can adopt now. That\u2019s super crucial. Also, you\u2019ll need their expected placement date (tbh, it's when the kid arrives), what your employee usually makes, when they got their paycheck, when they started working for you, and yeah, proof that what they earn gets taxed by the employer\u2019s Class 1 National Insurance. Just don\u2019t forget, or you are in trouble.\n\nAlright, to figure out this average weekly earnings jazz, it\u2019s simple but kinda not? You gotta include all earnings that could be taxed by National Insurance. And if they don\u2019t make **at least \u00a3123** over a period, they won\u2019t get this pay, get it? You just add everything they made during this time (which is usually 8 weeks before the matching week, I mean it seems easy). The end of this period is the last payday before the Saturday of that matching week, and you start counting from the last payday 8 weeks before that. Easy peasy, right?\n\nLike, imagine the matching date is December 7, 2024. So, for the matching week (which is Dec 1-6), check the previous paydays and do some adding. Don\u2019t forget to divide the total earnings by 8 - that\u2019s how you get the average. Don\u2019t round it up or down, just keep it real.\n\nIf someone\u2019s paid monthly, make it a bit tricky \u2013 you could divide it by 2 (that\u2019s for two months) and then multiply by 12 and divide by 52 to get to weeks. Who thought math could be this wild? And if they aren\u2019t paid normally, you might just have to figure stuff out differently like with days. \n\nOh, also if you mess up payments due to bank holidays or whatever, calculate average weekly earnings based on everything they actually got paid. If they were overpaid or underpaid, still include that. It\u2019s all about keeping it honest, man.\n\nAlso, any bonuses or gifts or whatever counts too, just make sure SAP is paid in cash, they can\u2019t swap that for anything else, like pizza or a free weekend.\n\nAnd then once you have their average, you calculate out how much SAP they\u2019re gonna get. It comes out weekly, with 39 weeks of it usually. For the first 6 weeks, it\u2019s 90% of what they earn, and later it\u2019s either 184 point 03 or 90%, whichever is less - yeah, pretty clear right?  \n\nSometimes people might get paid part of the week; that\u2019s fine just divide by 7 days for that or something if you need to align it with a payday or however. Oh, and for help, you can call that HM Revenue and Customs helpline if you're confused and need more info, seriously don\u2019t just guess.\n\nSo yeah, there you go! Just remember to keep all this straight and help that employee get their adoption pay sorted!",

You will then be paid monthly on the same date, unless your payment date falls on a weekend or Bank Holiday.\n\nYou can apply for an advance payment of your Universal Credit if you are in financial hardship while you wait for your first payment, for example, if you can\u2019t afford to pay your rent or buy food.\n\nYou will need to pay back your advance a bit at a time from your future Universal Credit payments, or by other means if you no longer get Universal Credit, for example, from your wages or other benefit you may be getting.\n\nIf you are already receiving Universal Credit you may also be able to get a Budgeting Advance to help pay for emergency household costs, for example, buying a new cooker or for help getting a job or staying in work.\n\n## How to apply for a Universal Credit advance\n\nYou can apply for a Universal Credit advance:\n\n  * before you get your first payment\n  * if you are already being paid Universal Credit and have told us of a change in your circumstances that means you will be paid more Universal Credit but have not yet been paid the increased amount\n\n\n\nTo apply for a Universal Credit advance you can:\n\n  * speak to your Jobcentre Plus work coach\n  * apply through your online account\n  * call the [Universal Credit helpline](https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/contact-universal-credit)\n\n\n\n### Applying through your online account\n\nChoose the \u2018apply for an advance\u2019 section to apply for an advance online through your account .\n\nYou can only apply for an advance online if you are within your first Universal Credit assessment period and you have had an interview at the jobcentre.

Repayments can be delayed for:\n\n  * 3 months if the advance is for a new claim\n  * 1 month if the advance is for a change of circumstances\n\n\n\nThis is only allowed in exceptional circumstances.\n\n## If you are refused an advance\n\nYou might be refused an advance if you:\n\n  * have not had your identity checked at the Jobcentre\n  * have enough money to last until your payment of Universal Credit\n  * live with parents, relatives or friends\n  * have any final earnings or redundancy payments\n  * have any accessible savings\n\n\n\nYou can ask for the decision to be reconsidered but you do not have a right to appeal.\n\n## If you no longer get Universal Credit and have not paid back your advance\n\nYou will need to continue to pay back your advance, even if you stop getting Universal Credit.\n\nIf you move from Universal Credit to another benefit the deductions will usually continue from your payments until the advance is paid off.\n\nIf you move off benefits you will receive a letter telling you how much you owe.

      "poorly_written_article": "So, like, when you wanna claim for Universal Credit, usually you gotta wait about, I dunno, 7 days after your first assessment period is over before you see any cash. After that, they pay you monthly on the same date, unless it\u2019s like a weekend or a Bank Holiday\u2014then you might have to wait longer, I guess.  \n\nIf you're kinda struggling with money while you wait for that first payment, you can ask for an advance, which is, like, money to help you pay rent or buy food or something. To pay it back, they'll take a bit out of your future payments, or if you're not getting Universal Credit anymore, they'll take it from your wages or other benefits.  \n\nThen there\u2019s this thing called a Budgeting Advance. If you already get Universal Credit, you can ask for this to help with emergencies, like if your cooker breaks, or maybe you need money to get a job or keep one.  \n\n### How to get that advance money  \n\nSo, you can get an advance before your first payment comes in, or if you\u2019re already getting Universal Credit but your situation changed and you\u2019re gonna get more money soon\u2014just haven\u2019t got it yet, ya know?  \n\nTo apply, you can:  \n- Chat with your job coach at the Jobcentre  \n- Use your online account to apply  \n- Call the helpline  \n\nIf you\u2019re applying online, pick the 'apply for an advance' section. But just remember, you gotta be in your first assessment period and had an interview at the jobcentre first. If you're past that, call the helpline. When you apply online, they\u2019ll show you how much you can get right there on your screen. Oh, and if you live with a partner, they\u2019ll wanna know if they\u2019re cool with you taking the advance.  \n\nIf you go the work coach or helpline route, you gotta explain your situation and give your bank info for where the money goes. Plus, you should\u2019ve had your ID checked at the Jobcentre too.  \n\n### When do you find out if you got it?  \n\nYou get a decision pretty quick, like usually the same day\u2014not bad, right?  \n\n### How much can you get?  \n\nSo, you might get up to 100% of what your Universal Credit payment is supposed to be. But remember, you gotta pay it back, either from your Universal Credit or other cash flow if you\u2019re out of benefits.  \n\n### Paying it back  \n\nWhen you apply online, they\u2019ll show you what your repayments will look like for different time frames. If you call the helpline, they\u2019ll figure out if you can handle the repayments and tell you how much to pay back every month and when the first payment's due.  \n\nThe repayment starts on the day of your first payment, and you typically gotta pay it back within:  \n- 24 months if you claimed after this date in April 2021.  \n- 12 months if it was before that.  \n- 6 months if it\u2019s for a change in your situation.  \n\nYou can even ask to delay repayments if you're really strapped for cash. They might let you pause for 3 months if it\u2019s a new claim or just a month if it\u2019s for changing stuff. But they gotta think it's serious for that to happen.  \n\n### What if they say no?  \n\nYou could get turned down, and that could be cuz you haven\u2019t had your ID checked or maybe they think you\u2019ve got enough money to last until your payment comes, or like, you live with family or whatever. You can request a reconsideration on the decision but there\u2019s no appeal rights.  \n\n### If you've stopped getting Universal Credit but owe money  \n\nEven if you\u2019re not on Universal Credit anymore, you gotta keep paying it back. If you switch benefits, they usually keep taking that money from your payments until you\u2019re all paid off. If you go off benefits, they'll send you a letter about what you owe and tell you to contact their Debt Management folks to sort it out. Don't just ignore it because that won't help!  \n\nIf you can\u2019t pay back the advance, those Debt Management people can help you out with making a plan.  \n\n### In an emergency  \n\nYou might be able to snag a Budgeting Advance for stuff like buying a new cooker or funeral costs\u2014basically emergency stuff. Just remember it\u2019s a loan, and you\u2019ll have to pay it back through your regular payments, so your amounts will be lowered until you handle that. They'll let you know how much less you\u2019ll get.  \n\nYou can read more about getting an advance in emergencies too, if you're interested.",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, like, when you apply for Universal Credit for the first time, your first payment usually comes 7 days after your first assessment period is over or whatever. After that, you get paid monthly on the same date unless it lands on a weekend or a bank holiday or something, which is kinda annoying. \n\nIf you're kinda broke while waiting for your first payment, you can request an advance payment of your Universal Credit. This is useful, you know, if you can't pay your rent or get food. \n\nBut heads up, you gotta pay back this advance payment later, even if you\u2019re not getting Universal Credit anymore. They\u2019ll take it out of your future Universal Credit payments or maybe from your salary or other benefits if you get those. \n\nIf you\u2019re already on Universal Credit, you might also be able to get a Budgeting Advance to help with, like, emergency home costs \u2013 you know, like if your oven breaks or if you need help finding or keeping a job. \n\n### How to apply for an advance payment of Universal Credit\n\nYou can ask for an advance payment when:\n-  you haven\u2019t received your first payment yet, or \n- you\u2019re already getting it and have let them know your situation changed so you're due more money, but it hasn't been paid out yet.\n\nYou can apply for this advance in a few ways:\n- talk to your work coach (that\u2019s the person at the Jobcentre that helps you) \n- apply online through your account \n- call the Universal Credit helpline.\n\n### Applying online\n\nSo, if you\u2019re applying online, just go to the \u2018apply for an advance\u2019 section in your account. But only if you\u2019re still in your first Universal Credit assessment period and have done an interview in the job centre. If you passed your first assessment, you gotta call the helpline.  \n\nWhen you apply online, the amount you might get will pop up on your screen, which is neat. If you\u2019re in a couple, they\u2019ll also ask if your partner agrees to you getting this advance too.\n\n### Applying through your work coach or helpline\n\nIf you're talking to your work coach or calling the helpline for the advance, you\u2019ll need to:\n- explain why you need it, \n- give them your bank account details (gotta tell them if you can't open an account), \n- have your identity verified at the job centre. \n\n### When will you hear back?\n\nYou should get a quick decision on your application, usually on the same day you request it. \n\n### How much can you get?\n\nYou might be able to get up to 100% of your estimated Universal Credit payment, which is a lot. But just keep in mind, you\u2019ll need to pay back the advance from future Universal Credit payments or through other means if you stop getting it.\n\n### Repayment costs\n\nIf you\u2019re applying for an advance online, they\u2019ll show you how much you need to pay back for different repayment periods on the screen. If you call, the helpline advisor will check if you can afford to pay it back. If they say yes, they\u2019ll tell you:\n- how much you can get,\n- how much will be deducted each month,\n- when the first repayment is due.\n\n### How repayments work\n\nRepayments come out of your monthly Universal Credit payment. The first deduction happens the day you get your first payment. You usually need to pay it back within:\n- 24 months if you applied for the advance on or after April 12, 2021 (because you made a new Universal Credit claim), \n- 12 months if it was before April 12, 2021, or \n- 6 months if your request was simply due to a change in your circumstances. \n\nYou can ask to delay your payments if you can't afford them, but that's only in special situations. \n\n### If your advance payment gets denied\n\nYour advance request might be denied if:\n- your identity hasn't been verified at the Job Centre,\n- you have enough money to get by until your Universal Credit is paid, \n- you\u2019re living with parents, relatives, or friends,\n- you\u2019ve got some final earnings or redundancy pay, or \n- you have savings available. \n\nYou can ask for a review of the decision, but there's no right to appeal.\n\n### If you stop getting Universal Credit and haven\u2019t paid back your advance\n\nYou still have to pay back the advance, even if you stop getting Universal Credit. If you switch from Universal Credit to another benefit, deductions will usually continue until the advance is fully paid.\n\nIf you stop getting benefits, you\u2019ll get a letter telling you how much you owe and you gotta reach out to the DWP Debt Management Centre to set up repayments. It\u2019s super important to not ignore that letter!\n\nIf you don\u2019t arrange to pay, the Department of Work and Pensions might recover what you owe by contacting your employer to take it from your earnings or getting an independent debt collection agency to collect the money for them.\n\n### If you can\u2019t pay your advance back anymore\n\nYou can contact the DWP Debt Management Centre if you find it impossible to pay back what you owe. They can help you figure out an affordable plan to return your advance and also provide: \n- help with setting up monthly repayments through Direct Debit\n- payment slips for checks or cash payments.\n\n**DWP Debt Management Centre**  \nPhone: 0800 916 0647  \n[Relay UK](https://www.relayuk.bt.com) - if you can\u2019t hear or speak on the phone: 18001 then 0800 328 5644  \nTextphone: 0800 916 0651  \nCall from abroad: +44 (0)161 904 1233  \nMonday to Friday, 8am to 7:30pm  \n[Find out about call costs](https://www.gov.uk/costau-galwadau)  \n\n[Video relay service](https://connect.interpreterslive.co.uk/vrs?ilc=DWP) for British Sign Language users \u2013 [check if you can use this service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oELNMfAvDxw)  \nMonday to Friday, 9am to 5pm\n\n### Getting an emergency advance payment\n\nYou might be eligible for a Budgeting Advance to help with:\n- emergency home costs like if you need to buy a new oven because yours just broke, \n- getting a job or staying in one, \n- funeral costs.\n\nThis Budgeting Advance is a loan, and you\u2019ll have to pay it back through your regular Universal Credit payments \u2013 which means your payments will be lower until you pay it back.

If the birth falls on a Sunday, that date is the first day in the week baby due.\n\n### Qualifying week (QW)\n\nThe QW is the 15th week (Sunday to Saturday) before the week baby due.\n\n## Before you begin\n\nYou need the following information to calculate your employee\u2019s Statutory Paternity Pay (SPP):\n\n  * for SPP \u2014 the declaration of family commitment signed by your employee \u2014 form SC3, SC4, SC5 or your own version\n  * the date your employee intends to stop work\n  * your employee\u2019s gross pay and the dates they were paid\n  * the date your employee started working for you\n  * confirmation that your employee\u2019s gross earnings are liable to employer\u2019s Class 1 National Insurance contributions (NICs) or would be but for their age or level of earnings\n\n\n\n## Calculate Average Weekly Earnings (AWE)\n\nAWE must include all earnings on which Class 1 NICs:\n\n  * are due\n  * would be due if the earnings were high enough\n\n\n\nSPP entitlement depends on your employee\u2019s AWE in a \u2018relevant period\u2019. For the tax year 2024 to 2025 the AWE must be \u00a3123 or more. Divide all the earnings paid in the relevant period by the number of days, weeks or months in that period.\n\n### The relevant period (births)\n\nThis is usually the 8-week period before the QW.\n\nThe end of the relevant period is the last normal payday on, or before, the Saturday of the QW. If the baby is born before or during the QW, the relevant period will end on the date the baby is born. \n\nThe start of the relevant period is the day after the last normal payday falling at least 8 weeks before the end of the relevant period.\n\n### Example weekly paid employee\n\nBaby due on 24 March 2025:\n\nQW | Payday | Last payday at least 8 weeks before the end of the relevant period | Last payday on or before the Saturday of the QW  \n---|---|---|---  \n8 December 2024 to 14 December 2024 | Friday | 18 October 2024 | 13 December 2024  \n  \nThe relevant period is 19 October 2024 to 13 December 2024.\n\nAdd up all the earnings paid between 19 October 2024 and 13 December 2024 and divide by 8 (the number of weeks in the relevant period).\n\nDo not round the figure up or down to whole pence.\n\n### Example monthly paid employee\n\nBaby due on 24 March 2025:\n\nQW | Payday | Last payday at least 8 weeks before the end of the relevant period | Last payday on or before the Saturday of the QW  \n---|---|---|---  \n8 December 2024 to 14 December 2024 | Last working day of the month | 30 September 2024 | 29 November 2024  \n  \nThe relevant period is 1 October 2024 to 29 November 2024.\n\nYou need to:\n\n  1. Add up all the earnings paid between 1 October 2024 and 29 November 2024.\n  2. Divide by 2 (the number of months in the relevant period).\n  3. Multiply by 12 (number of months in the year).\n  4. Divide by 52 (number of weeks in the year).\n\n\n\nDo not round the figure up or down to whole pence.\n\n### The relevant period (adoption)\n\nThis is usually the 8 week period before the MW.\n\nThe end of the relevant period is the last normal payday on or before the Saturday of the MW.\n\nThe start of the relevant period is the day after the last normal payday falling at least 8 weeks before the end of the relevant period.\n\n### Example \u2014 weekly paid employee (adoption)\n\nMatching date is 5 December 2024:\n\nMW | Payday | Last payday at least 8 weeks before the end of the relevant period | Last payday on or before the Saturday of the MW  \n---|---|---|---  \n1 December 2024 to 6 December 2024 | Friday | 11 October 2024 | 6 December 2024  \n  \nThe relevant period is 12 October 2024 to 6 December 2024.\n\nAdd up all the earnings paid during the relevant period and divide by 8 (the number of weeks in the relevant period).\n\nDo not round the figure up or down to whole pence.\n\n### Example \u2014 monthly paid employee (adoption)\n\nMatching date is 7 December 2024:\n\nMW | Payday | Last payday at least 8 weeks before the end of the relevant period | Last payday on or before the Saturday of the MW  \n---|---|---|---  \n3 December 2023 to 9 December 2023 | Last day of month | 30 September 2024 | 29 November 2024  \n  \nThe relevant period is 1 October 2024 to 29 November 2024.\n\nYou need to:\n\n  1. Add up all the earnings paid in the relevant period.\n  2. Divide by 2 (the number of months in the relevant period).\n  3. Multiply by 12 (number of months in the year).\n  4. Divide by 52 (number of weeks in the year).\n\n\n\nDo not round the figure up or down to whole pence.\n\n### Weekly paid employees without a whole number of weeks in the relevant period\n\nThis may happen if you bring forward your employee\u2019s normal payday because of bank holidays, for example at Easter or Christmas. Divide the earnings by the number of weeks wages were actually paid, not the number of weeks in the relevant period.\n\n### Employees paid multiples of a week\n\nThis may happen if you pay your employee fortnightly or 4 weekly. Divide the earnings by the number of whole weeks in the relevant period.\n\n### Monthly paid employees without a whole number of months in the relevant period\n\nWork out the number of rounded months as follows:\n\n  * count the number of whole months\n  * count the numbers of odd days\n\n\n\nRound up or down as follows:\n\n  * February \u2014 14 days or less round down, 15 days or more round up\n  * any month except February \u2014 15 days or less round down, 16 days or more round up\n\n\n\nDivide the earnings by this number of rounded months.\n\n### Employees not paid in a regular pay pattern\n\nDivide the earnings by the number of days in the relevant period and multiply by 7.\n\n### Mistimed payments\n\nThis only applies to regular payments of earnings paid other than on their normal date, for example due to a bank holiday.\n\nA mistimed payment:\n\n  * occurs when the date of the actual payment of earnings is earlier or later than the normal contractual payday, such as an annual holiday\n  * should not be confused with a payroll error, where a mistake is made in the payroll resulting in a shortfall of pay, when working out the AWE in the relevant period\n\n\n\nDivide the total earnings in the relevant period by the number of weeks wages were actually paid.\n\n### Overpayment or underpayment of earnings made during the relevant period\n\nAlways calculate AWE on all earnings actually paid within the relevant period. Where over or under payments of wages occur within the relevant period, include the overpaid or underpaid amount in the AWE calculation to decide if SPP is due.\n\n### Salary sacrifice\n\nIf an employee has entered into a [salary sacrifice](https://www.gov.uk/salary-sacrifice-and-the-effects-on-paye) with you their AWE is calculated using the amount of earnings actually paid to them after the sacrifice during the relevant period.\n\n### Contractual benefits\n\nThe calculation of AWE for SSP is based only on earnings which are subject to Class 1 NICs. Do not include the value of any benefits which are exempt from class 1 NICs (such as some [childcare vouchers](https://www.gov.uk/expenses-and-benefits-childcare) in your calculation.\n\n### Earnings in the relevant period affected by a backdated pay rise\n\nIf your employee receives a backdated pay rise which increases the amount of earnings already paid in the relevant period and was either:\n\n  * not entitled to SPP\n  * entitled to SPP at less than the standard rate\n\n\n\nYou must recalculate their AWE to check if they are:\n\n  * now entitled, and pay any SPP due\n  * entitled to an increase and pay any extra SPP due\n\n\n\n## Calculate SPP\n\nSPP is a weekly payment. It lasts for 1 or 2 complete weeks and the 2 weeks must be consecutive.\n\nYou must pay your employee the lower weekly rate of:\n\n  * \u00a3184.03 from 7 April 2024\n  * 90% of their AWE\n\n\n\nThe SPP period starts the day after the last day your employee worked before starting their paternity leave.\n\nSPP weeks start with the first day of the pay period. For example an SPP period which starts on a Wednesday will have pay weeks within the pay period which run from Wednesday to the following Tuesday.\n\n###  SPP paid part-weekly\n\nYou can pay SSP as part weeks to help you align your payments to your employee\u2019s normal pay period.\n\nYou can split the weekly rate into 2 parts. If you do this, you will make the calculation on the basis of dividing the weekly rate by 7.\n\nFor example, the pay period for a monthly paid employee covers 2 days in April and 5 days in May. Their employer should pay them two-sevenths in April and five-sevenths in May.\n\n## Help and advice\n\nYou can get advice from HMRC [Employer Helpline](https://www.gov.uk/contact/hm-revenue-customs/employer-enquiries).\n  *[MD]: Matching date\n  *[MW]: Matching week\n  *[QW]: Qualifying week\n  *[SPP]: Statutory Paternity Pay\n  *[NICs]: National Insurance contributions\n  *[AWE]: Average Weekly Earnings",

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so let\u2019s break this down super quick. We got some terms here that are kinda important if you're dealing with adoption stuff at work.  \n\n### Matching date (MD)  \nSo, this is just the day when the adoption agency tells your employee they found them a kid. Simple, right?  \n\n### Matching week (MW)  \nThis is the week, from Sunday to Saturday, when that match gets made.  \n\n### Week baby due  \nThis is pretty straightforward. It\u2019s like the week when the baby is supposed to be born. You start counting from the Sunday before and go to the Saturday after. If the baby pops out on a Sunday, then boom, that\u2019s the start of the due week.  \n\n### Qualifying week (QW)  \nAlright, so the QW is like, 15 weeks before the due week.  \n\n## Before you jump in  \nHere\u2019s what you need to know to figure out some payment kinda stuff called Statutory Paternity Pay (SPP):  \n- You need this family commitment paper signed by the employee\u2014form SC3, SC4, SC5 or whatever you made.  \n- You gotta know when the employee plans to stop working.  \n- Look at their gross pay, which is basically how much they make before anything gets taken out.  \n- The date they started working for you.  \n- Make sure their pay counts for those National Insurance contributions.  \n\n## Average Weekly Earnings (AWE)  \nSo, AWE needs to consider all the pay that gets hit by Class 1 National Insurance\u2014like the ones that are due or would\u2019ve been due if they made more money.  \n\nYou need a certain amount\u2014like, in 2024-2025, it should be at least \u00a3123. Just take all the pay and divide it by how many weeks or whatever the period is.  \n\n### Relevant period for births  \nThis normally stretches 8 weeks before the QW. Ends on the last payday before that Saturday of the QW. If the baby shows up early, then it ends on baby day. The start is right after the last payday from at least 8 weeks before.  \n\n### Example for weekly employees  \nSay, if a baby\u2019s due on March 24, 2025:  \n- QW runs from December 8 to December 14, 2024.  \n- Last payday before that 8 weeks back is October 18, 2024.  \n- Last payday before the QW is December 13, 2024.  \n- Your relevant period is October 19 to December 13.  \n\nJust add up the earnings for that time and divide by 8 weeks.  \n\n### Example for monthly employees  \nSame due date, March 24, 2025:  \n- QW is now December 8 to 14, 2024.  \n- Last payday was September 30, 2024, but remember they only get paid at the end of the month.  \n- Relevant period: from October 1 to November 29. Add up and do some more math like dividing by two, then 12, and then 52. Simple math, I promise!  \n\n### Adoption example for a weekly worker  \nSay, Matching Date is December 5, 2024:  \n- MW is December 1 to 6, 2024.  \n- Last payday at least 8 weeks back would be October 11, 2024.  \n- Relevant period? October 12 to December 6. Add those earnings, divide by 8.  \n\n### Monthly worker adoption  \nFor a matching date of December 7, 2024:  \n- MW is December 3 to 9, 2024.  \n- Same last payday\u2026 relevant period is October 1 to November 29. Do your thing with adding earnings, then divide.  \n\n### Weird situations  \nIf payments don\u2019t happen on the normal days \u2013 maybe a bank holiday messes it up \u2013 just divide by the actual weeks paid.\n\nAnd if you change things up with salary sacrifice or not paying regularly, you\u2019ll have to adjust your math.  \n\n### Calculate SPP  \nSPP is like weekly money, and it lasts either 1 or 2 weeks that are next to each other. You gotta pay the lesser of \u00a3184.03 or 90% of AWE.  \n\nSPP starts the day after work stops for leave. Like, say if they stop working on a Wednesday, then you count weeks from that point.  \n\n### Part-week payments  \nYeah, you can split it up if you need to make it fit better with regular pay timings. For month workers, if they span two months, just split it into 2 parts.  \n\nSo, that\u2019s pretty much it. It\u2019s kinda tricky but just keep your math on point.  \n\nIf you need help, HMRC has this helpline. You can totally reach out for more info.  \n \nAnd there you go! \ud83c\udf1f",

      "body": "## Overview\n\nIf you\u2019re unemployed or work less than 16 hours a week on average you may be able to get New Style Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA).\n\nNew Style JSA is a fortnightly payment that can be claimed on its own or at the same time as [Universal Credit](https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit).\n\nNew Style JSA is a contribution based benefit. Normally, this means you may be able to get it if you\u2019ve paid enough National Insurance (NI) contributions, usually in the 2 full tax years before the year you\u2019re claiming in. [National Insurance credits](https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-credits) can also count.\n\nIf you qualify, you can get New Style JSA for up to 182 days. After this your work coach will talk to you about your options.\n\nIf you qualify for both New Style JSA and Universal Credit, any New Style JSA you receive will be taken into account as income for Universal Credit.\n\n## Why should I claim New Style JSA?\n\nYour savings and capital (or your partner\u2019s savings, capital and income) are not taken into account when claiming New Style JSA. However, your earnings and any payment you\u2019re getting from a pension can affect the amount you may receive.\n\nWhile you receive New Style JSA you\u2019ll be awarded Class 1 National Insurance credits, which can help towards your State Pension and other contributory benefits in the future. It is a regular fortnightly payment.\n\nThe following table shows what you may be able to claim depending on your circumstances:\n\nYour situation | New Style JSA | Universal Credit  \n---|---|---  \nYou\u2019re unemployed or work less than 16 hours a week on average and you need support between jobs.  \n  \nYou\u2019ve paid and/or been credited with Class 1 NI contributions in the last 2 to 3 years as an employee. | You can apply for New Style JSA \u2013 even if your partner works or you and your partner have savings over \u00a316,000. | You can apply for Universal Credit if you (and your partner) have children or housing costs.  \n  \nYou can also apply for Universal Credit if you (and your partner) have \u00a316,000 or less in savings between you.  \n  \nYour partner\u2019s income will be taken into account as you\u2019ll need to claim Universal Credit as a couple.  \n  \nAny New Style JSA you receive will also be taken into account as income but you may still get Universal Credit.  \nYou\u2019re unemployed or work less than 16 hours a week on average. You need support between jobs and you\u2019ve not paid or have not been credited with Class 1 NI contributions, usually in the last 2 to 3 years. | You\u2019re unlikely to get New Style JSA if you\u2019ve not paid or have not been credited with NI contributions. | You can apply for Universal Credit if you (and your partner) have children or housing costs.  \n  \nYou can also apply for Universal Credit if you (and your partner) have \u00a316,000 or less in savings between you.  \n  \nYour partner\u2019s income will be taken into account as you\u2019ll need to apply for Universal Credit as a couple.  \nYou\u2019re unemployed or work less than 16 hours a week on average.  \n  \nYou\u2019ve paid and/or been credited with Class 1 NI contributions, usually in the last 2 to 3 years as an employee.  \n  \nBetween you, you and your partner have more than \u00a316,000 in savings. | You can apply for New Style JSA.  \n  \nNew Style JSA is not affected by you and your partner\u2019s savings. | You\u2019re unlikely to get Universal Credit because your savings are too high.  \nYou\u2019re unemployed or work less than 16 hours a week on average.  \n  \nYou\u2019ve paid and/or been credited with Class 1 NI contributions, usually in the last 2 to 3 years as an employee.  \n  \nYour partner works.  \n  \nBetween you, you and your partner have less than \u00a316,000 in savings. | You can apply for New Style JSA, as your partner\u2019s work does not affect your entitlement. | You can also apply for Universal Credit as you and your partner have less than \u00a316,000 in savings.  \n  \nYour partner\u2019s income will be taken into account as you\u2019ll need to apply for Universal Credit as a couple.  \n  \nAny New Style JSA you receive will also be taken into account as income but you may still get Universal Credit.  \nYou\u2019re unemployed or work less than 16 hours a week on average.  \n  \nYou receive pension income from previous employment.  \n  \nYou\u2019ve paid and/or been credited with Class 1 NI contributions, usually in the last 2 to 3 years as an employee. | You can apply for New Style JSA.  \n  \nYour pension income may be taken into account. | If you and your partner have less than \u00a316,000 of savings you might also get Universal Credit.  \n  \nYour pension income will be taken into account.  \n  \nAny New Style JSA you receive will also

and/or been credited with Class 1 NI contributions, usually in the last 2 to 3 years as an employee. | You can apply for New Style JSA as you\u2019ve paid/been credited with NI contributions so you may qualify.  \n  \nNew Style JSA does not include additional amounts for children. | You can also apply for Universal Credit, as it is a household assessment and you can receive an amount for children.  \nYou\u2019re unemployed or work less than 16 hours a week on average.  \n  \nYou live in rented accommodation, or have a mortgage or home loan, and need help to pay the cost.  \n

contributions so may qualify.  \n  \nNew Style JSA does not include an additional amount for housing costs. | You can also apply for Universal Credit, as it is a household assessment and you can receive an amount for your [housing costs](https://www.gov.uk/housing-and-universal-credit).  \n  \n## Eligibility\n\nTo get New Style JSA you usually need to have been working within the last 2 to 3

      "poorly_written_article": "So, if you\u2019re like, jobless or working less than 16 hours a week, you might be able to get this thing called New Style Jobseeker's Allowance, or JSA for short. It\u2019s a payment every two weeks, and like, you can claim it by itself or even while you\u2019re on Universal Credit, which is another kind of help for folks who need it (just check it out online if you wanna know more).\n\nAnyway, New Style JSA is kind of like, based on contributions you\u2019ve made. Usually, you gotta have paid enough National Insurance in the last two years or whatever. If you did the right stuff, you can get it for up to 182 days, and then your work coach, which is like a job helper person, will chat with you about what to do next. Oh, and if you\u2019re getting both New Style JSA and Universal Credit, just a heads up that any New Style JSA counts as income when they figure out how much Universal Credit you can actually get, which is kinda a bummer.\n\nNow, the cool part is when you claim New Style JSA, they don't look at your savings or your partner's savings when deciding if you can get it (like if you have a lot of money saved, it\u2019s not a big deal!), but if you have a job or pension income, that might change how much cash you actually get from the benefit.\n\nAnd while you're on New Style JSA, they give you these Class 1 National Insurance credits which can help with your State Pension later down the road, so that\u2019s a nice bonus or whatever. So here\u2019s a quick table for you:\n\n### Your situation \nOh, this is what it looks like:\n- Unemployed and worked less than 16 hours a week? Gotta have paid into Class 1 in the last couple of years.\n- If you\u2019ve got a partner with savings over \u00a316,000, supposedly it doesn\u2019t matter for JSA, but kinda does for Universal Credit. \n- If you haven't paid much into NI, then you probably just want to go for Universal Credit instead.\n\nAnd it goes on like that depending on what situation you're in with your work and money.\n\n### Eligibility\nSo basically, to get New Style JSA, you need to have worked enough in the past 2 to 3 years, paid your National Insurance stuff, be jobless or working like not much at all, and also be looking for work. If you can\u2019t work because of health stuff, then you might have to look into that other thing called Employment and Support Allowance instead.\n\n### How to claim\nIf you think you wanna claim, you need a bunch of stuff at the ready like:\n- your National Insurance number, which is like your social security number but in the UK\n- bank details, either yours or someone close you trust \n- info on where you worked in the last 6 months, all that Jazz. \n- Also, if you have a private pension, you gotta throw in that statement letter too.\n\n### Apply online\nYou\u2019re not allowed to do this online if you\u2019re under 18, which is kinda silly, but okay.\n\nAnd if you can\u2019t apply online, maybe you have a disability or whatever, just go ahead and call up Jobcentre Plus, which is like the help desk for job seekers. Oh, and if you\u2019re in Northern Ireland, they got their own places to help you too, just so you know.\n\n### After you apply\nOnce you submit your stuff, you should get a confirmation text or email, and then the Department for Work and Pensions, or DWP, will get back to you in about 14 days\u2014so don\u2019t stress if you don\u2019t hear anything right away.\n\n### Your JSA interview\nIf you get called in for an interview at Jobcentre Plus, you HAVE to go. They\u2019ll ask you a bunch of questions to make sure it's really you and then you\u2019ll sign some form saying what you\u2019ll do to look for work. Just bring a couple of forms of ID, like a passport or a driving license, and anything that proves where you live, like a utility bill or something, I guess.\n\n### Support at your interview\nYou can bring someone along if you want support. And you\u2019ll sign something that shows what your agreement is with your job coach about how you\u2019ll find work. \n\nIf you don\u2019t follow through with that agreement and don\u2019t have a good excuse, they might cut your benefits or stop them altogether, which is pretty harsh, but that\u2019s the rules.\n\n### If you disagree with a decision\nIf they say no to you and you think it\u2019s unfair, you can fight it and ask for something called a mandatory reconsideration. \n\nIt\u2019s a lot to handle, but hopefully, that clears up what you need to know about New Style JSA. Good luck!",

You can hit them up if you think you're about to be made redundant, during your notice period, or even like up to 13 weeks after you pop out of your job. \n\nThey can help you with all sorts of things like, writing CVs, job hunting, figuring out what benefits you can get, getting you to some training, and even organizing work trials. Yeah, if you're disabled or something, they can set you up with extra help like Access to Work. You could also get cash for stuff like traveling or child care, just need to check if you qualify though. \n\nSo shoot them an email at rrs.enquiries@dwp.gov.uk and don\u2019t forget to toss in your postcode! If you're in Scotland, check out PACE, and if you're in Wales, ReAct might be your thing. Oh, and if you\u2019re in Northern Ireland, there\u2019s a totally different service just for you guys. \n\nFor finding work, you can look at JobHelp to learn about scoring a job and nailing interviews. There\u2019s this Find A Job thing that helps you look and apply for stuff. Plus, you can also peek at social media or other job websites for opportunities. Consider getting an apprenticeship or even starting your own business if you feel adventurous. \n\nAnd hey, if you're trying to build some skills, think about careers advice or taking some courses, or you can even volunteer to learn somethin\u2019 new! \n\nOh, and apprentices, if you've been let go or are freaking out about losing your spot, they have details on what help you can grab and what funding is out there, so totally check that out. \n\nOK, let's talk about benefits. If you lost your job, you might be able to snag the New Style Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance if you're under State Pension age and didn\u2019t work at least 16 hours a week. And if you have health issues, you might wanna look into the New Style Employment Support Allowance instead, but same deal - check your National Insurance contributions. Universal Credit is there too if you\u2019ve got less than \u00a316,000 in savings and are under State Pension age. Oh, and there's Pension Credit for older folks, so don\u2019t forget about that.\n\nIf you need help figuring out all this benefits stuff, local advice groups like Advice Local or Citizen\u2019s Advice can be useful. You can even get a benefit calculator online to make it easier. And if you can\u2019t really get out to claim benefits and need some extra help, you might be able to get a DWP officer to visit you at home. \n\nIf you're already on benefits, make sure you tell them you lost your job and report any dough from redundancy pay. If you owe money or got paid too much in benefits, you can check out how to manage repayments. They even have a Breathing Space scheme for debt, which sounds kinda chill. \n\nRedundancy pay is a thing too, but if your employer is broke, you can apply for that cash from the government. And if you're due a tax refund, hey that\u2019s awesome! You might get some money back if you meet certain criteria after your last paycheck.\n\nGot pension questions? Use the State Pension forecast to see how much you can get. If redundancy impacts your workplace pension, bug your old employer for info. And if you're in your 50s with a defined contribution pension, MoneyHelper gives free advice.\n\nAnd lastly, if the whole redundancy thing is bumming you out, Mind and Samaritans can help too. Just remember, there are places to get support and it's totally normal to need it.",

You will see this on your Universal Credit statement.\n\nTo find your statement, sign into your online account and go to \u2018Payments\u2019. On your statement, look for \u2018What we take off \u2013 deductions\u2019.\n\n## Who to contact about money taken off your payment\n\nThis depends on what the deduction is for. [Find out who to contact](https://secure.dwp.gov.uk/find-out-who-to-contact-about-money-taken-off-your-universal-credit-payment/).\n\n## Types of debt\n\n### Advance payments\n\nThis is your repayment of a Universal Credit [advance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/universal-credit-advances).\n\n### Universal Credit overpayment\n\nThis is when you have been paid too much Universal Credit. To find out more about your overpayment, sign into your online Universal Credit account. Go to your journal and look for a message about overpayments.\n\nIf you believe you have been overpaid but have not heard from Universal Credit, you need to contact Universal Credit to tell them about this.\n\n### Tax credits and benefit overpayment\n\nThis is when you have been paid too much for any benefit other than Universal Credit. It includes tax credits and Housing Benefit overpayments.\n\nPenalties can be added to a benefit overpayment.\n\nIf you have been overpaid, you will have a journal message or letter explaining what the overpayment is for.\n\nIf you believe you have been overpaid but have not heard from DWP, you must [report it immediately](https://www.gov.uk/benefit-overpayments). If not, you may be prosecuted or have to pay a penalty.\n\n### Recoverable hardship payment\n\nYou can apply for a hardship payment if your Universal Credit payment has been reduced because of a fraud penalty or sanction.\n\nYou will need to pay this back once your fraud penalty or sanction has ended. When the amount you pay back has been agreed it cannot be changed.\n\n### Budgeting and crisis loan repayment\n\nThis is your repayment of a [budgeting or crisis loan](https://www.gov.uk/budgeting-help-benefits). How much you pay back is agreed at the time you accept the loan.\n\n### Other debts you owe \u2013 \u2018third party deductions\u2019\n\nThird party deductions are when money is taken off your Universal Credit to pay your debts for things including:\n\n  * utilities, like electricity, gas and water\n  * Council Tax\n  * child maintenance\n  * rent\n  * service charges\n  * court fines\n\n\n\nOnly 3 third party deductions can be taken at any one time.\n\nUniversal Credit will send you a message in your online journal when a third party deduction starts.\n\n## How much will be taken off your Universal Credit payment\n\nUniversal Credit calculate the amount taken from your payment at the end of every assessment period (one calendar month).\n\nThe amount taken off may change if your:\n\n  * earnings change\n  * other benefits change\n\n\n\nIt is not possible to tell you how much will be taken before this calculation takes place.\n\nNormally the most that can be taken from your payment to repay a debt is 25% of your [Universal Credit Standard Allowance](https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/what-youll-get). This is the basic amount you are entitled to, before money for things like childcare and housing costs are added.\n\nYou may have more than 25% of your Standard Allowance taken off if you pay a \u2018last resort deduction\u2019. A \u2018last resort deduction\u2019 helps to prevent you from being evicted or having your utilities cut off. It is paid directly to the person or organisation you owe money to.\n\n## What to do if you\u2019re struggling to repay your debt\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling, you can ask for a financial hardship decision to reduce the amount of benefit debt you pay.\n\nYou may be considered for this if you have money taken from your Universal Credit for:\n\n  * benefit debt\n  * Budgeting Loan and Crisis Loan repayment\n  * advances\n  * rent arrears (if they\u2019re taken at a rate greater than 10% of the standard allowance)\n\n\n\nIf a decision is made to reduce the amount you pay, it will be applied automatically to your next Universal Credit assessment period.\n\nFind out [who to contact about money taken off your Universal Credit payment](https://secure.dwp.gov.uk/find-out-who-to-contact-about-money-taken-off-your-universal-credit-payment/).\n\n## Advice on money and debt\n\nYou can [get help and advice](https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/other-financial-support) from the government, local councils and other organisations.\n  *[DWP]: Department for Work and Pensions",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, uh, if you\u2019ve got Universal Credit, they can like, take money off you if you owe a debt. You can see that on your Universal Credit statement, which is like super important to check, you know? \n\nFinding your statement is easy peasy! Just log into your online account, go to \u2018Payments\u2019, and then look for \u2018What we take off \u2013 deductions\u2019. Simple.\n\n### Who do you call if money was taken?\n\nDepends on what the deduction is for, so it\u2019s kinda different for everyone. You can go [here](https://secure.dwp.gov.uk/find-out-who-to-contact-about-money-taken-off-your-universal-credit-payment/) to figure out who to contact.\n\n### Types of debts you might see\n\nSo there are a few types of debt. First up is Advance Payments. That\u2019s like when you got money from Universal Credit in advance and now you have to pay it back. You can read more about that [here](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/universal-credit-advances).\n\nThen there's Universal Credit overpayment. This is when you get paid too much, which is a bummer, right? You can check your account for messages about if you got overpaid or whatever. If you think you got too much money but no one told you, you gotta let Universal Credit know.\n  \nTax credits and benefit overpayments are also a thing. It\u2019s basically when they give you more money than you should have received for other benefits like tax credits, sometimes you even get penalties for this.\n\nIf that happens, you will get a message or a letter explaining why. If you think something\u2019s up and haven't heard from DWP, definitely let them know fast because you might get into trouble. Not cool.\n\nThere\u2019s also the recoverable hardship payment, which you can ask for if your payment was cut because of fraud or whatever, but you gotta pay it back later. Like, they will stick to their guns on that for sure.\n\nYou can also owe money because of budgeting loans or crisis loans, and how much you pay back is set when you take the loan. Kind of fixed, I guess.\n\n### Third party deductions\n\nOh, and there\u2019s something called third-party deductions. This means money\u2019s taken from your Universal Credit to settle your debts for stuff like, you know, utilities (electricity, gas, water), rent, council tax, and even court fines. But only three deductions can happen at once, so that\u2019s a good thing, right? Universal Credit will message you when they start taking this money.\n\n### So how much they gonna take from your payment?\n\nOkay, so the Universal Credit folks calculate how much they take at the end of every month. It\u2019s when the assessment period ends, just so you know. Also, if your earnings or other benefits change, the amount taken could also change, which is kinda fluid.\n\nNormally, they can take up to 25% of your Universal Credit Standard Allowance to pay your debts, which is the money you get before they add other stuff like housing or childcare costs, right? If you really need help paying, they might take more, but for good reasons, like to stop you from losing your home or getting your utilities shut off. That\u2019s a life-saver for sure.\n\n### What if you\u2019re broke and can\u2019t pay back?\n\nIf you\u2019re really struggling, you can ask for a financial hardship decision to see if you can pay less on your benefit debt.

      "body": "## Employee earnings affected by a backdated pay rise\n\nIf your employee gets a backdated pay rise which increases the amount of earnings already paid in the relevant period, you must:\n\n  * recalculate the employee\u2019s average weekly earnings\n  * pay the extra Statutory Paternity Pay (SPP) due\n\n\n\nIf your employee was not entitled to SPP, you must recalculate their average weekly earnings to check if they may now be entitled and pay any SPP due.\n\n## Employee does not qualify for SPP: PAYE Settlement Agreements\n\nYou must recalculate your employee\u2019s average weekly earnings if all of the following apply:\n\n  * their average weekly earnings are less than the Lower Earnings Limit in force at the end of the qualifying or matching week\n  * they received any expense payments or benefits in kind in the relevant period\n  * the expenses or benefits were included in a PAYE Settlement Agreement\n\n\n\n## Salary sacrifice\n\nIf an employee has entered into a salary sacrifice with you, their average weekly earnings is calculated using the amount of earnings actually paid to them during the relevant period. SPP cannot be sacrificed and must be paid in full.\n\n## Foster carers\n\nStatutory Paternity Pay (SPP) may be available to foster carers who go on to adopt a child only if they satisfy the qualifying conditions.\n\n## Stillbirth\n\nYour employee is entitled to SPP if the baby is stillborn. A stillbirth occurs if the baby is stillborn from the 24th week of pregnancy. The rules are the same as for a live birth.\n\n## Premature or early birth\n\nIf the baby is born early there are special rules for when your employee has to give you evidence and when you start to pay. Your employee will not have been able to give you advance notice, but they must tell you the date of birth as soon as possible.\n\nThey must still tell you when they want to take their paternity leave and SPP, and whether they want to take 1 or 2 consecutive weeks. They can choose to take their leave any time between the actual date of birth and the end of an 8-week period running from the Sunday of the week the baby was originally due.\n\nIf the baby was born before the employee was due to give you their completed [form SC3](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ordinary-statutory-paternity-pay-and-leave-becoming-a-birth-parent-sc3), they should complete this form and give it to you as soon as possible, confirming the date the baby was due and the date of the actual birth. The form also includes a section for declaration of family commitment. This evidence should be accepted as being on time for the earlier start of SPP.\n\nIf they\u2019d already chosen the start date for their SPP but now need to change this to an earlier date, you should accept that they have given notice on time. You do not need a birth certificate or evidence of pregnancy.\n\nThe SPP period always starts the day after the last day your employee worked before starting their paternity leave. Your employee must tell you when they want to stop work.\n\n## Child dies\n\nEmployees still qualify for Paternity Pay and leave if the baby is either:\n\n  * stillborn from 24 weeks of pregnancy\n  * born alive at any point in the pregnancy but later dies\n\n\n\nEmployees are able to take any paternity leave booked prior to the death of the child. Any leave that has not been already booked can be booked and taken within 8 weeks of the child\u2019s death. \n\nParents may also be eligible for [Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay](https://www.gov.uk/parental-bereavement-pay-leave).\n\n## Child stops living with the adopter\n\nPayments will be affected if the child stops living with the adopter or is returned after being placed for adoption during the first year following birth or placement.\n\nEmployees are able to have any Paternity Pay or leave that was booked prior to the child no longer living with the adopter. Any leave which has not been booked by that point must be booked and taken within 8 weeks of the child no longer living with the adopter.\n\n## Child is not placed or placed later\n\nYour employee cannot be paid until the child is placed. They must tell you when the child is placed so you know when to start paying them. Do not start paying on the assumption that the child was placed on the expected date.\n\n## More than one child is placed\n\nMore than one child may be placed with the adopter under different arrangements. This can happen where 2 or more siblings are adopted from the same family. There is no entitlement to 2 separate periods of SPP and paternity leave if more than one child is placed under the same arrangement.\n\nThe employee will only be entitled to a further period of SPP and paternity leave where each child has been placed under separate adoption arrangements. If a separate matching certificate is issued this would be considered as a separate arrangement.\n\nIf there are separate arrangements, entitlement of up to a further 2 weeks of SPP and paternity leave will commence from the date the second child is placed with the adopter.\n\n## Employee dies\n\nIf your employee dies during the SPP period, you should pay SPP for the week in which they die, but not for any week in the pay period after that.\n\n## Employee leaves job before paternity leave is taken\n\nIf your employee has left their job, they cannot get paternity leave. If they left:\n\n  * before the date the baby was born, they are not entitled to SPP\n  * after the date the baby was born, they may be entitled to SPP\n\n\n\nIf your employee left after the date of birth, it does not matter why they left or that they\u2019re not coming back \u2014 they\u2019re entitled to SPP as long as they do not start work for a new employer during the SPP period.\n\nIf the employment ends after the baby has been born but before the planned start of the SPP period, you may treat the SPP period as beginning on the day after the last day of employment.\n\nYour employee must tell you whether they want 1 or 2 weeks\u2019 pay. However, your employee may choose when to begin their SPP period between the actual date of birth and the end of an 8-week period running from either:\n\n  * the day after the baby is born\n  * the day after the Sunday of the week the baby was originally due\n\n\n\n## Employee leaves job after being matched with a child\n\nIf your employee leaves their job:\n\n  * before the child is placed, they cannot get SPP or paternity leave\n  * after the child is placed but before the planned start of the SPP period, you may treat the SPP period as beginning on the day after the last day of employment or your employee can choose when to begin their SPP period \u2014 between the date the child is placed and the end of an 8-week period running from that date\n\n\n\nYour employee should still give you 28 days\u2019 notice of when they want you to start paying them.\n\n## Reinstatement after dismissal\n\nIf you dismissed your employee and they are then reinstated, they may be entitled to paternity leave.\n\nIf they did not work for you during the period starting 26 weeks before the qualifying week or matching week and ending when the baby was born or child was placed, they are entitled to paternity leave if either:\n\n  * they are then reinstated because an employment tribunal decides that you dismissed them unfairly\n  * you reinstate them as a result of a statutory grievance procedure\n\n\n\nAll the other conditions to entitlement must be satisfied.\n\n## Reinstatement after armed forces service\n\nIf your employee did not work for you during the continuous employment period because they were serving in the armed forces, and they return to work for you within 6 months of the end of their service, they may still be able to get SPP under the Reserve Forces (Safeguard of Employment) Regulations.\n\nFor SPP they must have both:\n\n  * been continuously employed by you for 26 weeks up to and including the qualifying week or matching week\n  * continued to work for you until the baby was born or the child was placed\n\n\n\nDo not count the period they served in the armed forces as part of this period.\n\nA week, in this instance, means Sunday to Saturday. Count part weeks as full weeks.\n\n## Break in employment\n\nFor SPP, your employee must have been continuously employed by you for at least 26 weeks up to and including the qualifying week or matching week. They must continue to work for you right up until the baby is born or until the child is placed.\n\nIf your employee with an ongoing contract of service has a break in employment for any of the following reasons, you should still treat them as continuously employed:\n\n  * temporary cessation of work \u2014 including short-term contract or agency workers\n  * public holidays \u2014 the employee can still get SPP\n  * sickness or injury \u2014 the employee can get SPP if the total period of incapacity is 26 weeks or less\n  * maternity leave \u2014 if the employee works for you before and after the break they can get SPP\n  * adoption leave \u2014 if the employee was on adoption leave and they worked for you before and after the break, they can get SPP\n  * paternity and parental leave \u2014 if the employee took paternity leave or parental leave and they worked for you before and after the break they can get SPP\n\n\n\n## Trade disputes or industrial action\n\nFor SPP your employee must have been continuously employed by you for at least 26 weeks into their qualifying week or matching week. They must continue to work for you until the baby is born or the child is placed.\n\nYou should not include weeks or part weeks where the employee is absent due to a trade dispute or industrial action as part of the 26 weeks, however, such weeks or part weeks do not break the continuity of employment.\n\n## Non-cash payments\n\nYou may normally pay some of your employee\u2019s earnings as a non-cash payment, for example providing board and lodgings or giving them goods or services. The value of the benefit provided during the SPP period may not be deducted from the SPP. You must pay any SPP in full.\n\n## Employee goes abroad\n\nIf your employee leaves the UK during the SPP period, for example to go on holiday or visit relatives living abroad, you are still liable to pay SPP during their absence.\n\n## Employee is not returning to work\n\nIf your employee is not returning to work, you must still pay them SPP. You cannot ask them to repay it.\n\n## Employee becomes sick\n\nIf your employee tells you that they\u2018re sick during the SPP period you must check whether they\u2019re entitled to Statutory Sick Pay or not. You cannot pay them SPP for any SPP week in which they are entitled to be paid Statutory Sick Pay.\n\nYou must give them [form SPP1](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statutory-paternity-pay-non-payment-explanation-spp1) \u2014 non-payment of Statutory Paternity Pay (SPP).\n\nTake a copy of the declaration made by your employee on one of the following forms and give them the original back (if your employee used the online form, they will need to download or print the form after completing it):\n\n  * [form SC3](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ordinary-statutory-paternity-pay-and-leave-becoming-a-birth-parent-sc3) \u2014 becoming a parent\n  * [online form](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/fill-online/apply-for-statutory-paternity-pay) (this replaces from SC4) \u2014 becoming an adoptive parent\n  * [online form](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/fill-online/apply-for-statutory-paternity-pay) (this replaces form SC5) \u2014 ordinary Statutory Paternity Pay and Leave when adopting from abroad\n\n\n\nBear in mind that:\n\n  * SPP weeks can start on any day of the week\n  * your employee will not normally be entitled to be paid Statutory Sick Pay from the first day they are incapable of work\n\n\n\n## Employee works for another employer\n\nNew arrangements will apply to parents of babies with an expected date of birth after 6 April 2024, or an expected adoption placement on or after 6 April 2024. For parents of babies expected to be born or placed for adoption before these dates existing arrangements apply.\n\nIf your employee works for another employer during a week for which they are claiming Statutory Paternity Pay, you need to check whether they were employed by that employer during the qualifying week or matching week. If they were not, it\u2019s up to your employee to tell you that they\u2019re working for that employer.\n\nIf your employee is working for someone who employed them in the qualifying week or matching week, you should continue to pay them SPP as normal.\n\nIf your employee works for someone who did not employ them in the qualifying week or matching week, you must not pay them for the weeks they worked for this second employer. Instead, you must give them [form SPP1](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statutory-paternity-pay-non-payment-explanation-spp1) \u2014 non-payment of Statutory Paternity Pay.\n\nThe employee will still retain their right to claim a second week of Paternity Pay in future if they have not yet claimed their full entitlement. \n\nTake a copy of the declaration made by your employee on either of the following forms and send the original back (if your employee used the online form, they will need to download or print the form after completing it):\n\n  * [form SC3](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ordinary-statutory-paternity-pay-and-leave-becoming-a-birth-parent-sc3) \u2014 becoming a parent\n  * [online form](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/fill-online/apply-for-statutory-paternity-pay) (this replaces from SC4) \u2014 becoming an adoptive parent\n\n\n\nThe employee will still retain their right to claim future Paternity Pay and leave if they have not yet claimed their full entitlement.\n\n## Employee taken into legal custody\n\nNew arrangements will apply to parents of babies with an expected date of birth after 6 April 2024, or an adoption placement on or after 6 April 2024. For parents of babies expected to be born or placed for adoption before these dates, existing arrangements apply.\n\nEmployees taken into police custody while claiming Paternity Pay, who are released without charge or custodial sentence, will have their Paternity Pay entitlement reinstated for:\n\n  * that week held in custody\n  * any subsequent week not yet taken \n\n\n\nEmployees who receive a custodial sentence will not lose their right to claim a second week of Paternity Pay in the future. For further details, read [form SPP1](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statutory-paternity-pay-non-payment-explanation-spp1).\n\nTake a copy of the declaration made by your employee on one of these forms and give them the original back (if your employee used the online form, they will need to download or print the form after completing it):\n\n  * [form SC3](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ordinary-statutory-paternity-pay-and-leave-becoming-a-birth-parent-sc3) \u2014 becoming a birth parent \n  * [online form](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/fill-online/apply-for-statutory-paternity-pay) (this replaces from SC4) \u2014 becoming an adoptive parent \n  * [online form](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/fill-online/apply-for-statutory-paternity-pay) (this replaces form SC5) \u2014 ordinary Statutory Paternity Pay and Leave when adopting from abroad \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s your employee\u2019s responsibility to tell you if they are taken into legal custody. Your employee is in legal custody if they are detained. Usually this means they are arrested or in prison.\n\nThey are not in legal custody if they are:\n\n  * voluntarily helping police with their enquiries\n  * out on bail\n  * serving a suspended sentence\n\n\n  *[SPP]: Statutory Paternity Pay\n  *[PAYE]: Pay As You Earn",

      "poorly_written_article": "So uh, you know, if your worker gets this thing called a backdated pay rise that makes their paycheck go up during that time, you gotta do some stuff. First, you need to, like, recalculate their average weekly earnings. Sounds fancy, right? And then, you also, um, need to pay them the extra Statutory Paternity Pay (SPP) that they might not have gotten before.\n\nNow, if your worker isn\u2019t getting SPP at all, well, you still have to check their weekly earnings to see if they might be eligible now and pay any SPP if it turns out they are. \n\nIf their earnings are, like, less than this Lower Earnings Limit that\u2019s kinda important during the qualifying week, then guess what? You still have to recalculate! This applies if they got any expense payments or benefits during that time that were included in a PAYE Settlement Agreement. Whatever that means!\n\nOh and, about salary sacrifice \u2013 that\u2019s when they give up some of their salary to, I dunno, save on taxes? Anyway, if they did that, you gotta base their average weekly earnings on what you actually *paid* them, not some fancy made-up number. And SPP can\u2019t be sacrificed, so that has to be full pay, or else.\n\nOkay, foster parents? They might get SPP only if they adopt a kid but they gotta meet some conditions. And hey, if a baby is stillborn, the worker's still eligible for SPP. Don\u2019t tell me that\u2019s not harsh! Just like, they need to follow the same rules as if it was a live birth? Ugh.\n\nAn early birth means your employee's gotta give you proof at some point, like when the baby actually shows up. They won\u2019t know exactly when but they need to tell you the birth date ASAP.\n\nIt gets complicated 'cause apparently they can still choose to take their leave at any time between the baby\u2019s birth and some 8-week window around when the baby was supposed to be born. If they got the SC3 form filled out after the baby comes early, even if they didn\u2019t give that to you on time, they can still have it count for SPP start.\n\nAnd if they lose a child, whether that's due to stillbirth or whatever, they can still take their planned paternity leave. Also, if a kid stops living with the adopter, then it can kinda mess with payments and leave time. Any pre-booked leave is still okay, but any new stuff needs booked within 8 weeks after the kid moves out.\n\nSo, like, they can\u2019t just start getting paid until, you know, the child is officially placed with them. Don\u2019t start payments based on when you think it\u2019ll happen\u2014stick to the real deal.\n\nIf you got more than one kid placed, that\u2019s tricky too. If, like, two siblings come together, they don\u2019t get extra SPP or extra leave, but if they\u2019re placed separately, classy \u2013 you might get more. But they have to have their own matching certificate for that.\n\nNow, what if the employee dies during the SPP stuff? Well, they\u2019ll get paid for that week but not after that. And if they leave the job before paternity leave starts, totally no leave for them. But if they left after the baby came, they can still get paid unless they start a new job.\n\nIf they leave after the kid is matched but before the kid is, like, placed, it\u2019s the same deal as leaving before the baby is born. Still need notice, though.\n\nIf you've let someone go but they get back to work and it\u2019s a whole thing, they may get paternity leave back. It\u2019s a legal mess.\n\nAnd if they were in the armed forces and come back to work after, they can still get SPP but need some conditions met. 26 weeks of service stuff and all that.\n\nAlso, any break in employment \u2013 like sick leave or maternity leave \u2013 doesn't count against their, uh, continuity of employment.  \n\nIf there\u2019s a trade dispute or something, don\u2019t count those weeks but it won\u2019t break the continuity of their employment either. \n\nIf your employee does stuff like trade disputes or gets non-cash payments, you can't deduct those from the SPP payments.\n\nIf they go abroad when they're supposed to be getting SPP, ya gotta pay them even if they\u2019re visiting their relatives or whatever.\n\nAnd if they\u2019re sick, oh boy! You gotta check if they can get Statutory Sick Pay instead. Don\u2019t just pay them to mess things up.\n\nFinally, if they\u2019re working for someone else while on SPP, you\u2019ve gotta check their employment history during that time and may need them to fill out paperwork. But even if they do work for someone else, they might still retain their right to future SPP later. So weird, huh?",

      "body": "## Overview\n\nIf you are ill or have a health condition or disability that limits your ability to work you may be able to get New Style Employment and Support Allowance (ESA).\n\nNew Style ESA is a fortnightly payment that can be claimed on its own or at the same time as Universal Credit (UC).\n\nNew Style ESA is a contributory benefit. Normally, this means you may be able to get it if you\u2019ve paid or been credited with enough National Insurance contributions in the 2 full tax years before the year you\u2019re claiming in.\n\nThis guidance is also available in an [easy read format](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/easy-read-new-style-employment-and-support-allowance).\n\n## Eligibility\n\nTo get New Style ESA you\u2019ll need to have been an employee or self-employed and paid (or been credited with) [National Insurance contributions](https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance), usually in the last 2 to 3 years.\n\nYou can get New Style ESA on its own or at the same time as Universal Credit. If you apply for and are awarded both benefits, the New Style ESA you are paid will reduce your Universal Credit payment by the same amount.\n\nYou will not get any New Style ESA if you\u2019re getting [Statutory Sick Pay](https://www.gov.uk/statutory-sick-pay) (SSP) from an employer \u2013 but you can apply up to 3 months before your SSP ends. If you get New Style ESA, it will be paid as soon as your SSP ends.\n\n## How to claim\n\n### Apply online\n\nYou can apply for New Style ESA online.\n\nYou\u2019ll need:\n\n  * your National Insurance number\n  * your bank or building society account number and sort code (you can use a friend or family member\u2019s account if you do not have one)\n  * your doctor\u2019s name, address and telephone number\n  * a [fit note](https://www.gov.uk/taking-sick-leave) (sometimes called a \u2018sick note\u2019 or a \u2018statement of fitness for work\u2019) if you\u2019ve not been able to work for more than 7 days in a row because of a disability or health condition\n  * details of your income if you\u2019re working\n  * the date your Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) ends if you\u2019re claiming it\n\n\n\nYou must apply by phone if you\u2019re an [appointee](https://www.gov.uk/become-appointee-for-someone-claiming-benefits) applying on behalf of someone else.\n\nYou cannot get New Style ESA if you\u2019re getting Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) from an employer. You can apply for New Style ESA up to 3 months before your SSP ends.\n\n[ Apply now ](https://www.apply-new-style-employment-support-allowance.service.gov.uk/)\n\n### If you cannot apply online\n\nCall the Jobcentre Plus new claims helpline if:\n\n  * you cannot make an application online\n  * you\u2019re an appointee for someone\n\n\n\n#### Jobcentre Plus new claims helpline\n\nTelephone: 0800 055 6688  \nTextphone: 0800 328 1344  \n[Relay UK](https://www.relayuk.bt.com/) (if you cannot hear or speak on the phone): 18001 then 0800 055 6688  \nBritish Sign Language (BSL) [video relay service](https://connect.interpreterslive.co.uk/vrs?ilc=DWP) if you\u2019re on a computer - find out how to [use the service on mobile or tablet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oELNMfAvDxw)  \nWelsh language telephone: 0800 328 1744  \nMonday to Friday, 8am to 5pm  \n[Find out about call charges](https://www.gov.uk/call-charges)\n\n### After you apply\n\nThe Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will contact you within 10 working days of applying.\n\n## The New Style ESA Process: what to expect\n\n### 1\\. Start your claim\n\nStart your claim by applying online or calling the Universal Credit helpline.\n\n### 2\\. Attend the appointment with your work coach\n\nAttend your \u2018new claim appointment\u2019 and agree with your work coach what actions you\u2019ll need to take to get payments. This is called a \u2018Claimant Commitment\u2019. The appointment will normally be over the phone.\n\nIf a medical professional has said you might have less than 12 months to live, you will not need to attend an appointment or make a Claimant Commitment. Find out more about [getting benefits if you might have less than 12 months to live](https://www.gov.uk/terminal-illness-benefits).\n\n### 3\\. Notification and first payment\n\nYou\u2019ll get a letter from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) telling you if you\u2019ll get New Style ESA and how much.\n\nFurther information on how much New Style ESA to expect\n\n### 4\\. Provide updates about your health and circumstances\n\nTo keep getting New Style ESA you must send fit notes regularly and report any change in your circumstances.\n\nFind out how to [send DWP a fit note](https://www.gov.uk/send-fit-note?step-by-step-nav=a661e652-204c-4abf-a2ce-9f183aca85b9)\n\nFurther information on reporting a change in your circumstances\n\n### 5\\. Complete and return the ESA50 form\n\nYou will be sent form ESA50 in the post, usually within 4 weeks of your first payment. The ESA50 form is a capability for work questionnaire and is your chance to tell DWP how your health condition, disability or illness affects your ability to work.\n\nYou must send the form back within 28 days of the date you receive it from DWP.\n\nFurther [information and advice on completing the ESA50 form](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/sick-or-disabled-people-and-carers/employment-and-support-allowance/help-with-your-esa-claim/fill-in-form/)\n\nIf you\u2019re also claiming Universal Credit the form will be called UC50, you\u2019ll only have one form to complete.\n\n### 6\\. Your Work Capability Assessment\n\nAfter you return your ESA50 form you may be asked to go to an assessment, called a \u2018Work Capability Assessment\u2019. You will be contacted to arrange a date and time for the assessment.\n\nThe Work Capability Assessment is used to find out how much your health condition, disability or illness affects your ability to work. It assesses what you can do, as well as what you cannot do.\n\nYou\u2019ll be asked questions about how your condition affects you in your day to day life. It gives you the opportunity to explain if, and how, your health condition or disability may vary over time.\n\nAssessments can be in person, by video call or on the phone. You\u2019ll be told how your assessment will take place.\n\nYou\u2019ll stay on the \u2018assessment rate\u2019 until a decision can be made on your Work Capability Assessment.\n\nMore information on [Work Capability Assessments](https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance/your-esa-claim).\n\nIf you\u2019re claiming both New Style ESA and Universal Credit you\u2019ll only have to attend one Work Capability Assessment.\n\n### 7\\. Decision letter\n\nYou\u2019ll get a letter with a decision on whether you have limited capability for work or limited capability for work and work-related activity, and if you will continue to receive New Style ESA. It will also tell you if you\u2019ll need to be assessed again at some point in the future.\n\nIf you do need to be assessed again in the future, you\u2019ll be sent another ESA50 form at the appropriate time. This normally happens within 3 years.\n\nIf you disagree with the decision you can ask for the decision to be looked at again - this is called a [mandatory reconsideration](https://www.gov.uk/mandatory-reconsideration?step-by-step-nav=a661e652-204c-4abf-a2ce-9f183aca85b9).\n\nIf you\u2019re claiming both New Style ESA and Universal Credit you\u2019ll get 2 decision letters. If you fail to return form UC50 or fail to attend the Work Capability Assessment you won\u2019t be entitled to both New Style ESA and Universal Credit.\n\n## After your claim is assessed\n\nIf you\u2019re entitled to ESA you\u2019ll be placed in one of 2 groups:\n\n  * a work-related activity group (you cannot work now, but can prepare to work in the future, for example by writing a CV)\n  * a support group (you cannot work now and you\u2019re not expected to prepare for work in the future)\n\n\n\nYou will:\n\n  * usually be in the support group if your illness or disability severely limits what you can do\n  * be in the support group if a medical professional has said you might have less than 12 months to live\n\n\n\n### If you\u2019re in the work-related activity group\n\nYou must attend regular interviews with a work coach. They can help you improve your skills or write a CV to help you get back into work.\n\n### If you\u2019re in the support group\n\nYou\u2019re usually in this group if your illness or disability severely limits what you can do. You do not have to go to interviews. You can tell your work coach if you\u2019d like to take part in work-related activities.\n\n## How much New Style ESA to expect\n\n### Assessment phase\n\nThe first 13 weeks of your claim is called the \u2018assessment phase\u2019 and you are paid the basic allowance.\n\nHow much you\u2019ll get depends on your age:\n\n  * aged 18 to 24 years \u2013 up to \u00a371.70 (per week)\n  * aged 25 years and over \u2013 up to \u00a390.50 (per week)\n\n\n\n### Main phase\n\nIf you have been found to have limited capability for work, you will move onto the \u2018main phase\u2019 for New Style ESA and you will get the basic allowance, plus a \u2018support component\u2019 if you are put in the support group.\n\n  * basic allowance (standard rate) \u2013 up to \u00a390.50 (per week)\n  * support component \u2013 \u00a347.70 (per week)\n\n\n\n### Payment\n\nNew Style ESA is paid at the end of every 2 weeks into your bank, building society or credit union account.\n\n## Pension income\n\nIf you get an occupational or personal pension that pays more than \u00a385 a week, your New Style ESA payment will be reduced by half of the amount over the \u00a385 limit.\n\n## Reporting a change of circumstances\n\nYou need to report changes to your circumstances so you keep getting the right amount of New Style ESA (and Universal Credit if you are claiming both).\n\nYour claim might be stopped or reduced if you do not report a change straight away.\n\nA change of circumstance can include:\n\n  * any changes to your health condition or disability\n  * going into hospital or a care home or sheltered accommodation\n  * starting or stopping work, education, training or an apprenticeship\n  * moving house\n  * changing your name\n  * changes to your pension\n  * changing your doctor\n  * going abroad for any length of time\n\n\n\nCall the New Style ESA helpline if you\u2019re not sure whether you need to report a change.\n\n### How to report changes of circumstances\n\nYou can report a change of circumstances by:\n\n  * calling the New Style ESA helpline\n  * writing to the Jobcentre Plus office that pays your New Style ESA \u2013 the address is on the letters you get about your New Style ESA\n\n\n\n### New Style ESA helpline\n\nTelephone: 0800 169 0310  \nTextphone: 0800 169 0314  \n[Relay UK](https://www.relayuk.bt.com) \u2013 if you cannot hear or speak on the phone: 18001 then 0800 169 0310  \nWelsh language: 0800 328 1744  \nMonday to Friday, 8am to 5pm  \n\n\n[Find out about call charges](https://www.gov.uk/call-charges)\n\nIf you\u2019re claiming Universal Credit as well as New Style ESA, you must report changes to both services.\n\n### Universal Credit helpline\n\nTelephone: 0800 328 5644  \nTextphone: 0800 328 1344  \n[Relay UK](https://www.relayuk.bt.com) \u2013 if you cannot hear or speak on the phone: 18001 then 0800 328 5644  \nWelsh language: 0800 328 1744  \nMonday to Friday, 8am to 6pm  \n\n\n[Find out about call charges](https://www.gov.uk/call-charges)\n\n### British Sign Language (BSL) video relay service\n\nBritish Sign Language (BSL) [video relay service](https://portal.starleaf.com/webrtc?name=DWP&target=DWP@interpreterslive.call.sl) if you\u2019re on a computer - find out how to [use the service on mobile or tablet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZJc6OKmAUA).\n\nThe video relay service is available Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm.\n\nIf you\u2019re in Northern Ireland [contact the NI Direct Employment and Support Allowance Centre](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/contacts/employment-and-support-allowance-centre).\n\n## If you get a sanction\n\nYour ESA can be reduced if you do not attend interviews or do work-related activity as agreed with your work coach in your \u2018Claimant Commitment\u2019.

      "poorly_written_article": "So, if you're sick or have some kind of health issue or a disability that's making it tough to work, you might qualify for this thing called New Style Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). It\u2019s cash you get like every two weeks, and you can apply for it alone or also grab Universal Credit (UC) at the same time. \n\nNow, New Style ESA is based on what you\u2019ve paid into National Insurance, like, normally you'd need to have enough contributions in the last two years before you apply. Super straightforward, right? You can also find info in an easy read format if you need it, which is nice!\n\n### Who Can Get It?\n\nTo snag New Style ESA, you gotta have either worked or been self-employed and paid your National Insurance - usually within the last two to three years. You can get it alone or with UC, but if you're awarded both, keep in mind that they'll just take the amount of ESA you get off of your UC payments. \n\nIf you\u2019re getting Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) from your job, you can\u2019t get this New Style ESA, but you can apply like three months before your SSP runs out, and they'll start paying you the ESA right after your SSP ends. \n\n### How to Get It\n\nSo you can apply online, right? When you wanna do that, make sure you have a few things ready, like:\n- Your National Insurance number (you need this, for real)\n- Your bank details (or a friend\u2019s bank info if you don\u2019t have one)\n- Your doctor's deets (name, address, phone)\n- A fit note if you\u2019ve been outta work for more than a week\n- Info about your income if you\u2019re working\n- The end date for your SSP if you\u2019re on it. \n\nSo yeah, if you\u2019re helping someone else apply, you gotta call.\n\nAnd just to remind ya, no New Style ESA if you\u2019re on SSP, okay? \n\n### If Not Online\n\nIf you can\u2019t go online to apply, you gotta ring up the Jobcentre Plus new claims helpline. Not too tricky! \n\nYou\u2019ll hear back from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) in about 10 working days after you apply, just so you know.  \n\n### Steps After Application\n\nAlright, here\u2019s the deal with what comes next:\n1. Start your claim, either online or call them up.\n2. You\u2019ll get this appointment with a work coach that\u2019ll help you figure out your next steps. You might have to do a Claimant Commitment.\n3. Wait for a letter that tells ya if you're approved and how much you'll get.\n4. You\u2019ve got to keep sending them fit notes and any updates on your health.\n5. Fill in this ESA50 form they\u2019ll send you which is basically a questionnaire on how your health affects your work ability. Don\u2019t take too long on that, you\u2019ve got 28 days to send it back! \n6. You might get asked to go for a Work Capability Assessment where they\u2019ll check your health and see what you can/can\u2019t do. You\u2019ll get questions about how your health messes up your everyday life. \n7. Finally, you\u2019ll get a decision letter letting you know if you\u2019re good for ESA and what groups you might fall into.\n\n### What Happens if You Qualify\n\nIf everything checks out, you might be put in one of two groups:\n- Work-related activity group: You can\u2019t work now but might work later. Expect interviews and help from a coach.\n- Support group: For those who seriously can\u2019t work. No need to show up for interviews. \n\n### Money Stuff\n\nFirstly, the first 13 weeks is called the assessment phase. Depending on how old you are, you'll get different amounts. For example, if you\u2019re between 18 and 24 years old, you can get up to \u00a371.70 per week, and if you\u2019re over 25, it can go up to \u00a390.50 each week. Then, if you qualify for the main phase, you could get more money and even a support component if you\u2019re in that support group. Payments come every two weeks, just so you\u2019re aware.\n\nAnd by the way, if you have a pension that pays over \u00a385 a week, they'll cut your ESA by half of whatever\u2019s over that. \n\n### Keeping Your Info Updated\n\nMake sure to report any changes in your life, like if you get healthier, start working, or just anything else that might change what you're getting. Not reporting could mean they stop or cut your payments.\n\nTo report changes, you can just call their helpline or write a letter to the Jobcentre Plus.\n\nAnd hey, don't forget, if you get a sanction because you didn\u2019t do what was agreed in your Claimant Commitment, your money could drop. You can argue against sanctions if you have a legit reason too. \n\nSo, that\u2019s the scoop on New Style ESA! It\u2019s a bit of a process but not impossible, you know?  \n",

This allowance is a fortnightly payment that can be claimed independently or alongside Universal Credit (UC). Generally, eligibility for New Style ESA hinges on having sufficient National Insurance contributions over the past two years, with this guidance also available in an easy read format.",
            "badly_written_snippet": "Should it occur that you find yourself in a state of illness, or perhaps you possess a medical condition or a disability that serves to restrict your operational capacity within the workforce, it is conceivable, though not guaranteed, that you could potentially secure something known as New Style Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) \u2013 which is by the way, an astonishingly incredible benefit for those in dire need. This ESA, which is disbursed every two weeks can be independently claimed or possibly at the same juncture as Universal Credit (UC), but seriously don\u2019t quote me on that! Typically, in the most usual sense, eligibility could be determined by evaluating your contributions to National Insurance over a two-year period prior to the current claim, and by the way, there's this super cool easy read version of all this information!

Additionally, you won't receive New Style ESA if you are currently on Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) from your employer, although you can apply up to three months before your SSP expires.",
            "badly_written_snippet": "In the grand scheme of things, to potentially become eligible for New Style ESA (not to be confused with a mere handout mind you), one needs to demonstrate a history of being a worker, whether you were grinding it out as an employee or blazing your own trail as self-employed! Contributions to National Insurance within a time frame of 2-3 years prior must be reviewed, which can be a downright labyrinth of bureaucracy, if we're being honest! Now, if you happen to be juggling both New Style ESA and Universal Credit, it's really a bit of a balancing act, because one will naturally reduce the other when it comes to financial ramifications\u2014it's like a dance of dollars over here! Also, if you\u2019re presently basking in the glow of Statutory Sick Pay from your employer, by the way, ciao to New Style ESA until that cash flow runs dry - you can still apply beforehand; isn\u2019t that just uncharacteristically generous?"

Just a heads-up though; you need your National Insurance number, which is kind of like a secret key to the kingdom of benefits, not to mention your bank deets too! Oh, and if you\u2019ve been out of the workforce for over a week because life decided to throw some curveballs, better bring along a fit note; sounds fancy, right? And, spoiler alert, if you\u2019re raking in Statutory Sick Pay, well, forget about even tasting the sweet essence of New Style ESA!

      "body": "## Overview\n\nIf you are ill or have a health condition or disability that limits your ability to work you may be able to get New Style Employment and Support Allowance (ESA).\n\nNew Style ESA is a fortnightly payment that can be claimed on its own or at the same time as Universal Credit (UC). If you get both benefits, your Universal Credit payment is reduced by the amount you get for New Style ESA.\n\nNew Style ESA is a contributory benefit. Normally, this means you may be able to get it if you\u2019ve paid or been credited with enough National Insurance contributions in the 2 full tax years before the year you\u2019re claiming in.\n\nThis guidance is also available in an [easy read format](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/easy-read-new-style-employment-and-support-allowance).\n\n## Why should you claim New Style Employment and Support Allowance?\n\nYour (or your partner\u2019s) savings will not affect how much New Style ESA you\u2019re paid. If your partner works, it does not affect your claim.\n\nMost income is not taken into account (but a personal pension can affect the amount you may receive).\n\nWhile you receive New Style ESA you\u2019ll earn Class 1 National Insurance credits, which can help towards your State Pension and other contributory benefits in the future.\n\nIt is a regular fortnightly payment.\n\nThis table shows what you may be able to claim depending on your circumstances.\n\nYour situation | New Style ESA | Universal Credit  \n---|---|---  \nYou\u2019ve lost your job and you\u2019re too sick to work. You need help with living costs e.g. rent.  \n  \nYou\u2019ve paid and/or been credited with NI contributions in the last 2 to 3 years (employed or self\u2013employed). | You can claim New Style ESA \u2013 even if your partner works or you and your partner have savings over \u00a316,000 | You can also claim UC if you (and your partner) have \u00a316,000 or less in savings between you.  \n  \nYour partner\u2019s income will be taken into account as you will need to claim UC as a couple.  \n  \nUC is a household assessment and you can receive an amount for children and housing costs.  \n  \nAny New Style ESA you receive will also be taken into account as income but you may still get UC.  \nYou\u2019ve lost your job and you\u2019re too sick to work.  \n  \nYou have not paid any NI contributions in the last 2 to 3 years | You are unlikely to get New Style ESA if you have not paid NI contributions. | You can claim UC if you (and your partner) have \u00a316,000 or less in savings between you.  \n  \nYour partner\u2019s income will be taken into account as you will need to claim UC as a couple.  \n  \nUC is a household assessment and you can receive an amount for children and housing costs.  \nYou\u2019re ill and unable to work.  \n  \nYou\u2019ve paid and/or been credited with NI contributions in the last 2 to 3 years (employed or self\u2013employed).  \n  \nBetween you, you and your partner have more than \u00a316,000 in savings. | You can claim New Style ESA even if your partner works or you and your partner have savings over \u00a316,000. | You are unlikely to get UC because your savings are too high.  \nYou\u2019re ill and unable to work.  \n  \nYou\u2019ve paid and/or been credited with NI contributions in the last 2 to 3 years (employed or self\u2013employed).  \n  \nYour partner works.  \n  \nBetween you, you and your partner have less than \u00a316,000 in savings. | You can claim New Style ESA, as your partner\u2019s work does not affect it. | You can also claim UC as you and your partner have less than \u00a316,000 in savings.  \n  \nYour partner\u2019s income will be taken into account as you will need to claim UC as a couple.  \n  \nAny New Style ESA you receive will also be taken into account as income but you may still get UC.  \nYou work but you\u2019re off sick and your Statutory Sick Pay has ended.  \n  \nYou\u2019ve paid and/or been credited with NI contributions in the last 2 to 3 years (employed or self\u2013employed). | You can claim New Style ESA. | If you and your partner have less than \u00a316,000 of savings you might also get UC.  \nYou\u2019re ill and unable to work.  \n  \nYou receive pension income from previous employment.  \n  \nYou\u2019ve paid and/or been credited with NI contributions in the last 2 to 3 years (employed or self\u2013employed). | You can claim New Style ESA.  \nYour pension income may be taken into account. | If you and your partner have less than

get UC.  \nYou\u2019re ill and unable to work.  \n  \nYou have children.  \n  \nYou\u2019ve paid and/or been credited with NI contributions in the last 2 to 3 years (employed or self-employed). | You can claim New Style ESA as you have paid NI contributions so may qualify.  \n  \nNew Style ESA does not include additional amounts for children. | You can also claim UC, as it is a household assessment and you can receive an amount for children.  \nYou\u2019re ill and unable to work.  \n  \nYou live in rented accommodation, or have a mortgage or home loan, and need help to pay the cost.  \n  \nYou\u2019ve paid and/or been credited with NI contributions in the last 2 to 3 years (employed or self-employed). | You can claim New Style ESA as you have paid NI contributions so may qualify.  \n  \nNew Style ESA does not include an additional amount for housing costs. | You can also claim UC, as it is a household assessment and you can receive an amount for your [housing costs](https://www.gov.uk/housing-and-universal-credit).  \n  \n## Eligibility\n\nTo get New Style ESA you usually need to have been working within the last 2 to 3 years, and have made (or been credited with) Class 1 or Class 2 [National Insurance contributions](https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance).\n\nThis can be through employment or self\u2013employment.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure how much National Insurance you\u2019ve paid, you can [check your National Insurance record](https://www.gov.uk/check-national-insurance-record) online.\n\n## How to apply\n\n### Apply online\n\nYou can

If you would like this, tell the Health Assessment Advisory Service using the contact details in your appointment invite letter.\n\n## How the assessment happens\n\nAssessments can be in person, by video call or on the phone. You\u2019ll be told how your assessment will take place.\n\nIf you\u2019re asked to attend in person [you\u2019ll be told how to do this safely because of coronavirus (COVID-19)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/attending-a-face-to-face-health-assessment-during-covid-19).\n\nYou can have someone else with you at your assessment, for example a friend or support worker.

They can help you improve your skills or write a CV to help you get back into work.\n\n### If you\u2019re in the support group\n\nYou\u2019re usually in this group if your illness or disability severely limits what you can do. You do not have to go to interviews. You can tell your work coach if you\u2019d like to take part in work-related activities.\n\n## How long you\u2019ll get ESA for\n\nNew Style ESA lasts for 365 days if you\u2019re in the work-related activity group.\n\nThere\u2019s no time limit if you\u2019re in the support group.\n\nTo keep getting ESA you must report any [change in your circumstances](https://www.gov.uk/employment-support-allowance/change-of-circumstances). You may also need to [send fit notes](https://www.gov.uk/send-fit-note) regularly.\n\n## If you get a sanction\n\nYour ESA can be reduced if you do not attend interviews or do work-related activity as agreed with your work coach in your \u2018Claimant Commitment\u2019. This reduction can continue for up to 4 weeks after you restart work-related activities.\n\nYou\u2019ll get a letter to say you may be sanctioned. Tell your work coach if you have a good reason for not doing what was agreed in your \u2018Claimant Commitment\u2019.\n\nYou\u2019ll get another letter if the decision is made to give you a sanction. Your benefit will only be affected once a decision has been made.\n\nYou should [contact your local council](https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council) immediately if you claim Housing Benefit or Council Tax Reduction. They\u2019ll tell you what to do to continue getting support.\n\nIf you get a sanction you can [ask for the decision to be looked at again](https://www.gov.uk/appeal-benefit-decision).\n\nYou will not get a sanction if you\u2019re in the support group.\n\n## If you\u2019ve been paid too much\n\nIf you give wrong or incomplete information or do not report a change straight away, you might be paid too much. If you are, you might have to [pay some of the money back](https://www.gov.uk/benefit-overpayments).\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance\n  *[UC]: Universal Credit\n  *[NI]: National Insurance\n  *[SSP]: Statutory Sick Pay\n  *[DWP]: Department for Work and Pensions",

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so let's break it down. If you're sick or got some kinda health issue, or even a disability that makes it tough to work, you might wanna check out this thing called New Style Employment and Support Allowance, or ESA. You can get this money every two weeks, like a paycheck but for not working. You can get it alone or mix it with Universal Credit (UC), but if you get both, they kinda take away from each other.\n\nNow, New Style ESA's a contributory benefit, which basically means you gotta have paid enough National Insurance over the past two years or so to even be eligible, no big deal right? Oh, and by the way, they have this easy-read version for folks who need that too. \n\nSo, uh, the reason you might wanna claim this ESA thing is that your savings and your partner's income don\u2019t really mess with how much you get. If your partner has a job or you both have savings that are kinda high, it still doesn't matter much in this case. And just so you know, a personal pension can kinda change how much you might see in your account. Also, while you\u2019re getting this ESA, you\u2019ll rack up some Class 1 National Insurance credits, which is helpful later when you\u2019re old and want that State Pension.\n\nNow, here's a kinda confusing table about all the situations where you might want to claim.\n\nLike, if you've lost your job and sick, but paid your National Insurance, you can totally claim New Style ESA plus UC if your savings are under \u00a316,000. And then if you haven\u2019t paid NI, no ESA for you but UC is still fair game if you keep savings low. Then there's all these other scenarios too, like being ill with kids or living in a rented place. Just keep in mind, if you\u2019re too sick and you have some cash in the bank, they might show up and say, \"nah, you're too rich for UC.\"  \n\nOh! And you need to have worked within the last two to three years, like real work or even freelance stuff, to be able to apply. Not sure how much you've paid? You can totally check your National Insurance record online. \n\nNow the nitty-gritty on how to apply, you gotta do it online, duh? Have your NI number, a bank account, your doctor\u2019s details, and a fit note, which is like a doctor\u2019s note, if you\u2019ve been out of work for over a week. If you can\u2019t use the computer, you gotta call a number. There\u2019s this whole helpline thing just for that.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve applied, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) gets back to you in about ten working days. If you\u2019re in the clear to get ESA, they\u2019ll hit you up to set a chat with a work coach, who tells you what\u2019s next and you gotta sign some commitment thingy to get your cash. If you\u2019re sick enough (like less than a year to live sick), then you skip the appointment part.\n\nFast forward, if all goes well and you qualify, you either join a work group where they help you get back in the grind or a support group where it\u2019s chill and you don\u2019t have to deal with regular meetings. If you don\u2019t meet the requirements, then you\u2019ll get a letter explaining why you don\u2019t get ESA, sad day.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget, if you don\u2019t play by the rules with your work coach and skip appointments, they might cut some of your money for a while. And if the cashiers mess up and give you too much money, get ready to pay that stuff back, hard to keep track sometimes right?\n\nSo yeah, that\u2019s the deal with New Style ESA. Good luck! Hope this helps!",

This will depend on the new rules for claiming benefits for more than 2 children and your circumstances.\n\nIf you currently claim benefits or tax credits and aren\u2019t moving to Universal Credit until a later date, you\u2019ll continue to be paid an additional amount for each child you look after as long as you remain responsible for the same children and your circumstances remain the same.\n\nBy child (or qualifying young person) we mean anyone aged under 16, or a young person aged under 20 who enrolled on, accepted or started full-time non-advanced education, such as A-levels, or approved training before they turned 19.\n\n## If you\u2019ve already claimed Universal Credit or Child Tax Credit\n\nIf you claimed [Universal Credit](https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit) or [Child Tax Credit](https://www.gov.uk/child-tax-credit) in the previous 6 months but it was stopped for a period of time, you\u2019ll get the same support if you re-claim, as long as you remain responsible for the same children and your circumstances remain the same.\n\nYou will be contacted by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and told when you should claim Universal Credit.\n\nThis is to make sure you don\u2019t lose out financially when you move to Universal Credit. You will need to have been entitled to Severe Disability Premium within the month immediately before you move to Universal Credit.\n\n## If you become responsible for another child\n\nYou should report the birth of a child in the usual way for [Universal Credit](https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit), [Child Tax Credit](https://www.gov.uk/child-tax-credit) and [Income Support](https://www.gov.uk/income-support) so that we can decide if an additional amount can be paid.\n\nIn general, you\u2019ll be entitled to an additional amount for any child or qualifying young person born before 6 April 2017.\n\nIf you\u2019ve another child who isn\u2019t living with you when you claim Universal Credit, but then returns to your household, you\u2019ll be entitled to a child amount for them, as long as they were born before 6 April 2017.\n\nNote: If this happens and you\u2019re being paid Child Tax Credit/Universal Credit for a child born after 6 April 2017, then you may not get Child Tax Credit/Universal Credit for that child unless an exception applies.\n\nIf you\u2019re responsible for a child or children through adoption or as part of non-parental caring arrangement then you\u2019ll be able to receive an additional amount for these children. This will not affect any amounts you may get for any other children in your household. You\u2019ll need to provide documents to support this.\n\n## If you\u2019re making a new claim\n\nIf you\u2019re making a new claim, Universal Credit will pay an additional amount for all children born before 6 April 2017.\n\nIf you have been getting support for children in [Universal Credit](https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit), [Child Tax Credit](https://www.gov.uk/child-tax-credit), [Income Support](https://www.gov.uk/income-support) or [Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance](https://www.gov.uk/jobseekers-allowance) in the last 6 months, you will continue to get the child amount for the same number of children, as long as you remain responsible for the same children.\n\nThis protection will also be maintained through family formation changes, such as splitting from a partner in a joint claim, or coupling to form a new joint claim.\n\nExceptions (special circumstances) that applied in a previous award of [Universal Credit](https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit), [Child Tax Credit](https://www.gov.uk/child-tax-credit), [Income Support](https://www.gov.uk/income-support) or [Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance](https://www.gov.uk/jobseekers-allowance) will continue to apply in your new Universal Credit award, unless the conditions for that exception are no longer met.\n\nIf you are entitled to an award of an existing benefit that includes a Severe Disability Premium, or have been entitled to an award of an existing benefit within the last month that included a Severe Disability Premium, and have continued to meet the Severe Disability Premium eligibility conditions, you cannot currently claim Universal Credit.\n\nYou should, if eligible, claim other benefits or remain on your existing benefits until you are told to claim Universal Credit.\n\nUse a [benefits calculator](https://www.gov.uk/benefits-calculators) to check what benefits you could get if you can\u2019t currently claim Universal Credit.\n\n## Special circumstances\n\nWe call these special circumstances, exceptions.\n\nYou may be able to get the additional child amount for a third or subsequent child or qualifying young person (you are responsible for) born on or after 6 April 2017 (after 6 April 2017 for Income Support) if the child or children:\n\n  * were born as part of a multiple birth\n  * were born as a result of a non-consensual conception (including rape) or conceived when you were in a controlling or coercive relationship\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re responsible for a child or children (regardless of the order they joined the household) who:\n\n  * are adopted from local authority care\n  * are in your care, either formally or informally and it\u2019s likely they would otherwise be looked after by a local authority\n  * are a child of your child\n\n\n\nThen you\u2019ll receive an additional amount for them and this won\u2019t affect any amounts you may get for any other children in your household.\n\nFor all of the exceptions above, you\u2019ll need to provide us with supporting documents.\n\n### Multiple birth\n\nYou can get extra Universal Credit and Child Tax Credit for your third and subsequent children if they\u2019re born as part of a multiple birth, apart from one child in that birth. This means the exception applies to the additional children in that birth.\n\nWhere the first child of the multiple birth is either the first or second child in the household, we\u2019ll pay a child amount for all the children born as part of the multiple birth. This means you can get an additional amount for that child (the first child) as well as the other child or children of the multiple birth.\n\n### Adopted from local authority care\n\nThis exception applies to a child or children adopted from local authority care. You\u2019ll be able to receive an additional amount from the date you become responsible for them, rather than the date the child was born.\n\nThis exception doesn\u2019t apply if:\n\n  * children are adopted from abroad\n  * you or your partner are, or were the step-parent of the adopted child before they were adopted\n\n\n\nSince 28 November 2018, the policy for when we\u2019ll pay for children in non-parental caring arrangements or who are adopted has changed. More information about these changes is available.\n\n### Children living with friends or family under caring arrangements\n\nThis includes:\n\n  * formal caring arrangements, such as a Child Arrangements Order, a Guardianship Order\n\n  * informal caring arrangements if it\u2019s likely the child would otherwise be looked after by a local authority, supporting documents will be required using the [informal care form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-a-child-who-is-informally-living-with-you)\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re caring for a child and either you or your partner are the parent or step-parent of that child, you won\u2019t get an additional child amount for them unless either:\n\n  * they are your first or second child\n\n  * the child was born before 6 April 2017 (on or before 6 April 2017 for Income Support)\n\n\n\n\nIf a child you\u2019re responsible for has a child of their own, you\u2019ll also get the extra child amount for the \u2018child of your child\u2019 until either your:\n\n  * child turns 16 and claims benefit on their own\n\n  * child leaves the household, leaving their child in your care\n\n\n\n\nNote: If your child leaves the household but their child stays in your care, you\u2019ll no longer be able to claim this exception, but you may be able to claim for their child under the non-parental caring arrangements exception.\n\nThis also applies to the child of a qualifying young person for tax credits.\n\nSince 28 November 2018, the policy for when we\u2019ll pay for children in non-parental caring arrangements or who are adopted has changed. More information about these changes is available.\n\n### Non-consensual conception\n\nYou may be able to get the additional child amount for a third or subsequent child if either:\n\n  * your child was born as a result of a non-consensual conception (including rape)\n  * you were in a controlling or coercive relationship with the other biological parent of the child at the time of the conception\n\n\n\nTo get the additional child amount of benefit for this reason you must not be living with the other (biological) parent of the child.\n\nIf you don\u2019t already have documents to support this special circumstance, you\u2019ll need to fill in the [\u2018Support for a child conceived without your consent\u2019 form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-a-child-conceived-without-your-consent) with the help of an approved third party.\n\nFind out which [approved third parties](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/support-for-a-child-conceived-without-your-consent) are available.\n\nDWP, HMRC and local authority staff won\u2019t question you about the circumstances of the conception, any information you provide will be kept confidential.\n\nIf you\u2019re eligible to receive the additional amount for your child, the reason for the exception won\u2019t appear in any benefit letters.\n\n## More information about support for children in Universal Credit\n\nRead more information about:\n\n  * [support for a maximum of 2 children in Universal Credit](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/universal-credit-and-families-with-more-than-2-children-information-for-claimants)\n\n  * [support for a maximum of 2 children in Child Tax Credit](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/child-tax-credit-exceptions-to-the-2-child-limit)\n\n  * [support for a maximum of 2 children for Income Support claimants with dependants allowance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/income-support-with-dependants-allowance-the-2-child-payment-limit)\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll still be entitled to additional support in respect of any disabled children, regardless of the total number of children in your household.\n\nYou may still be entitled to help with childcare costs for any of your children, even if you do not get the additional child amount for all of your children.\n\nPassported benefits, for example, free school meals for children won\u2019t be affected.\n\nYou should continue to report the birth of a child and any changes in your circumstances involving children or young people so you do not miss out on what you are entitled to.\n\nChanges to tax credits claims should be reported to HMRC, changes to Universal Credit and other benefits should be reported to DWP.\n\n## Qualifying young person\n\nGenerally, a qualifying young person is someone aged 16 to 19 who is in education or training.\n\nA qualifying young person is someone aged over 16 in any of these situations:\n\n  * in full time education or not - from their 16th birthday until 31 August following that birthday\n\n  * if enrolled in, or accepted for approved training or a course of education which is non-advanced education - up to 31 August following their 19th birthday\n\n\n\n\nThe approved training or course must be provided at a school, college or elsewhere approved by a qualifying body.\n\nThe average time spent during term time in tuition, practical work, supervised study or taking exams must be more than 12 hours a week. Meal breaks and unsupervised study aren\u2019t counted. Where the qualifying young person is aged 19, the education or training must have begun before they reached their 19th birthday, or they must have been enrolled to undertake that education or training before reaching that age.\n  *[DWP]: Department for Work and Pensions\n  *[HMRC]: Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs",

      "poorly_written_article": "So like, here's the scoop on benefits for kids. If you're already getting help for two or more kids, you can keep getting that cash. But like, you won't get any extra for more than two unless those kids were born before April 6, 2017 (or like, if some special stuff is going on). \n\nWhen you have another kid or whatever, you gotta tell the DWP, that's the Department for Work and Pensions. They\u2019ll let you know if your benefits for the dependents will change based on the new rules. Super important, huh? Just make sure you\u2019re still the one responsible for those kids.\n\nNow, if you\u2019re still applying for stuff like Income Support, and your kids stay the same, you\u2019ll keep getting help for them! That\u2019s a good deal!  And oh, a child is anyone under 16, or a kid under 20 who's still in school or some training program like A-levels, so keep that in mind! \n\nIf you tried to claim Universal Credit or Child Tax Credit in the last half a year but it stopped for some reason, you can just claim again and get the same help as before! You just have to be looking after the same kids and all that. \n\nAlso, when you become responsible for another kid like a new baby or something, let the DWP know so they can figure out if you can get more cash. If your new kid was born before that April date and you\u2019re already on Universal Credit, then you can get extra money. But if they were born after that date\u2014well, that's kinda complicated, and you might not get more unless you're in some special situations. \n\nSpeaking of special situations, if your third kid, or any kid after that, was born from a multiple birth or maybe there was some really bad stuff like non-consensual conception or you were in a controlling relationship when they were conceived, you might be able to get some additional funds. You\u2019ll need to give them some paperwork to back that up. \n\nAnd if you adopted kids from local authority care, you can get money for those kids too! Like, this all gets a little trickier with all these regulations and rules, so if you're in a confusing type of caring situation, just make sure you\u2019ve got your documents ready!\n\nIf you\u2019re making a new claim, don\u2019t forget that the additional amount applies to kids born before April 6, 2017. If you've been getting benefits for them in the last six months, you can still claim that amount for the same number of kids as long as you're still looking after them. And if your situation changes like if you break up with a partner or whatever, you won't lose out on that cash! \n\nSo yeah, keep all this in mind! Any changes in your kid situation, tell the DWP or HMR\u2026err HMRC? Yeah, the tax people, so nothing slips by you. It\u2019s pretty important for getting the support you need!  I mean, we don\u2019t want you missing any benefits you could be entitled to, right? Also, kids with disabilities - you still get some help no matter how many kids you've got, so check into that! \n\nOh, and if you've got a kid aged 16 to 19 who\u2019s doing some form of education, that's also a thing! Make sure they\u2019re enrolled and stuff; that\u2019s how you get a qualifying young person summed up. \n\nSo basically, just keep your eyes open for all these rules and let DWP know when anything changes with your kids, okay? Don\u2019t lose out on getting the help you can have!",

In England a further \u00a3842 million is being provided to extend the Household Support Fund by a further 12 months from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024.

It\u2019s like this thing where they give you money when you're struggling, and you can find info on how to get that help on the government website. They kicked it off on September 30, 2021, to give around \u00a3500 million to vulnerable families for essentials during the winter season, which lasted from October 6, 2021, to March 31, 2022\u2014just so you know.\n\nThis fund helped folks in England. Councils were in charge of handing it out, and they would give out small payments, right? This was to help people get what they needed daily, like food and clothes and paying those bills for heat and light and stuff.\n\nThen, on March 23, 2022, the Chancellor dude announced they\u2019d be extending it. So, it carried on until September 30, 2022, with another \u00a3500 million top-up for local authorities to keep supporting those who really needed it. Isn\u2019t that thoughtful?\n\nThen in May 26, 2022, bam! Another extension, which pushed the fund to March 31, 2023, with yet another extra \u00a3500 million to use. They apply this Barnett formula thing for funding, so it's like, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland get some of that cash too\u2014like \u00a379 million total, but it\u2019s up to them how they wanna spend it. Didn\u2019t they already throw a whole \u00a33 billion at this thing since October 2021? Crazy, right?\n\nFast forward to November 17, 2022, and the Chancellor\u2019s out there announcing another \u00a31 billion for these household essentials. So, yeah, it adds up to \u00a32.5 billion total. And in England, there\u2019s another \u00a3842 million to keep the fund alive for a year from April 1, 2023, to March 31, 2024. \n\nThey\u2019re still doing that Barnett formula, so the devolved governments will figure out how to use that extra funding. The money just keeps coming, huh? \n\nNow, jumping ahead to the Spring Budget, the bigwigs figured they\u2019d throw in another \u00a3500 million to keep extending the Household Support Fund. That means from April 1, 2024, until September 30, 2024, England's local councils will get an extra \u00a3421 million to help needy folks, super generous.\n\nAnd then in September 2, they said they\u2019re giving another \u00a3500 million for, yet again, extending the fund until March 31, 2025. So in total, since 2021, they\u2019ve shelled out about \u00a33.5 billion, including that Barnett stuff. So just under \u00a33 billion went to Local Authorities in England. It\u2019s confusing who\u2019s responsible for all this, but hey, they\u2019ll figure out how to spend that extra Barnett funding among themselves. Hope this helps someone out there!",

And then there's the Maternity Allowance, which is MA, but I think you got that already. \n\nOkay, so how these benefits are calculated is a bit of a mystery, but basically, it\u2019s about your earnings and stuff. If you\u2019ve been working and all that before the baby comes, you might get some cash during your time off. And, like, the eligibility rules? They're kinda specific, you know? You gotta meet certain conditions\u2014like how long you\u2019ve been working or however much you earn. I mean, they don\u2019t just hand out money to everyone! \n\nNow, when does all this cash come in? Well, usually it kicks in when you, um, stop working because of the baby. That\u2019s when you can start getting paid and stuff. It\u2019s probably a good idea to check the exact dates or something to make sure you don't miss out. Yeah, that\u2019s pretty much it.

They must be 21 or over to get the National Living Wage.\n\nContracts for payments below the minimum wage are not legally binding. The worker is still entitled to the National Minimum Wage or National Living Wage.\n\nWorkers are also entitled to the correct minimum wage if they\u2019re:\n\n  * part-time\n  * casual labourers, for example someone hired for one day\n  * agency workers\n  * workers and homeworkers paid by the number of items they make\n  * apprentices\n  * trainees, workers on probation\n  * disabled workers\n  * agricultural workers\n  * foreign workers\n  * seafarers\n  * offshore workers\n  * non-family members living in the employer\u2019s home who share in the work and leisure activities and are treated as one of the family, for example au pairs\n\n\n\n## Apprentices\n\nApprentices are entitled to the [apprentice rate](/national-minimum-wage-rates) if they\u2019re either:\n\n  * under 19\n  * 19 or over and in the first year of their apprenticeship\n\n\n\nApprentices over 19 who have completed the first year of their apprenticeship are entitled to the correct minimum wage for their age.\n\n## Not entitled to the minimum wage\n\nThe following types of workers are not entitled to the National Minimum Wage or National Living Wage:\n\n  * [self-employed people](/employment-status/selfemployed-contractor) running their own business\n  * [company directors](/employment-status/director)\n  * [people who are volunteers](/volunteering/pay-and-expenses) or voluntary workers\n  * workers on a government employment programme, such as the Work Programme\n  * members of the armed forces\n  * family members of the employer living in the employer\u2019s home\n  * workers younger than school leaving age (usually 16)\n  * higher and further education students on work experience or a work placement up to one year\n  * people shadowing others at work\n  * workers on government pre-apprenticeships schemes\n  * people on the following European Union (EU) programmes: Leonardo da Vinci, Erasmus+, Comenius\n  * people working on a Jobcentre Plus Work trial for up to 6 weeks\n  * share fishermen\n  * prisoners\n  * people living and working in a religious community\n\n\n\nEmployers who offer [internships (sometimes called \u2018work placements\u2019 or \u2018work experience\u2019)](/employment-rights-for-interns) should check if the person is entitled to the minimum wage.\n\n## Voluntary work\n\nYou\u2019re classed as doing voluntary work if you can only get certain limited benefits (for example reasonable travel or lunch expenses) and you\u2019re working for a:\n\n  * charity\n  * voluntary organisation or associated fundraising body\n  * statutory body\n\n\n\nContact the [Acas helpline](/pay-and-work-rights) to find out if you should be getting the minimum wage.\n\n## Employers and the minimum wage \n\nEmployers must pay workers the correct minimum wage.\n\nYou can read guidance on the [minimum wage rates](/national-minimum-wage-rates) and [who they apply to](/national-minimum-wage/who-gets-the-minimum-wage).\n\n## What\u2019s not included in minimum wage calculations\n\nSome payments must not be included when the minimum wage is calculated.\n\nThese are:\n\n  * payments for the employer\u2019s own use or benefit, for example if the employer has paid for travel to work\n  * things the worker bought for the job and is not refunded for, such as tools, uniform, safety equipment\n  * tips, service charges and cover charges\n  * extra pay for working unsocial hours on a shift\n\n\n\nFind out [what counts as working time](/minimum-wage-different-types-work).\n\n## What\u2019s included in minimum wage calculations\n\nSome payments must be included when the minimum wage is calculated.\n\nThese are:\n\n  * Income Tax and National Insurance contributions\n  * wage advances or loans\n  * repayment of wage advances or loans\n  * repayment of overpaid wages\n  * things the worker paid for that are not needed for the job or paid for voluntarily, such as meals\n  * [accommodation provided by an employer](/national-minimum-wage-accommodation) above the offset rate (\u00a39.99 a day or \u00a369.93 a week)\n  * penalty charges for a worker\u2019s misconduct\n\n\n\nExample\n\nJohn is 27 and works 40 hours a week. He earns \u00a311.50 per hour or \u00a3460 a week.\n\nHe pays \u00a310 a week to rent his uniform and the money\u2019s not refunded.\n\nTo calculate his minimum wage, John\u2019s employer must deduct the uniform rental from the pay.\n\nThis means John makes \u00a3450 per week (\u00a3460 minus \u00a310) which is \u00a311.25 per hour. This is below the minimum wage rate of \u00a311.44.\n\nJohn\u2019s employer will need to pay the arrears back to John.\n\nRead the [detailed guidance on calculating the minimum wage](/government/publications/calculating-the-minimum-wage) for more on what counts and does not count towards the minimum wage, eligibility, how to calculate the minimum wage and how it is enforced.\n\n## Employer checks\n\nIt\u2019s a criminal offence for employers to not pay someone the National Minimum Wage or National Living Wage, or to fake payment records.\n\nEmployers who discover they\u2019ve paid a worker below the correct minimum wage must pay any arrears immediately. Use the [National Minimum Wage and National Living Wage calculator for employers](/minimum-wage-calculator-employers) to check a worker has been paid correctly.\n\nHM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) officers have the right to carry out checks at any time and ask to see payment records. They can also investigate employers if a worker complains to them.\n\nIf HMRC finds that an employer has not been paying the correct rates, any arrears have to be paid back immediately. There will also be a fine and offenders might be named by the government.\n\n### Keeping records\n\nIt\u2019s the employer\u2019s responsibility to keep records proving that they are paying the minimum wage. These records must be kept for at least 6 years if they:\n\n  * were created on or after 1 April 2021\n  * still had to be kept on 31 March 2021 under the previous rule that records must be kept for 3 years\n\n\n\nThe period records must be kept for starts from the last day of the pay reference period after the one they cover.\n\nThey do not have to be kept in any particular form, for example they can be paper or computer records. But employers must be able to produce records for an individual pay reference period in a single document.\n\nMost employers use their payroll records as proof of:\n\n  * total pay - including pay deductions, allowances and tips\n  * total hours worked - including absences and overtime\n\n\n\nEmployers may also need to keep records such as:\n\n  * agreements about working hours, pay and conditions, such as contracts\n  * documents that show why a worker is not entitled to the minimum wage\n\n\n\n## Pay reference periods\n\nPay reference periods are usually set by how often someone is paid, for example one week, one month or 10 days. A pay reference period cannot be longer than 31 days.\n\nA worker must be paid the minimum wage, on average, for the time worked in the pay reference period.\n\n## Worker disputes over minimum wage \n\nWorkers who think their pay is below the correct minimum wage rate should talk to their employer first.\n\nIf this does not solve the problem, they can ask the employer in writing to see their payment records. The worker can take someone with them and make copies of the records.\n\nIf an employer owes the worker any arrears they have to pay these back.\n\nWorkers can call the confidential [Acas helpline](/pay-and-work-rights) to help them solve a payment dispute.\n\nWorkers can also [make a complaint to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)](/government/publications/pay-and-work-rights-complaints) about their employer or employment agency or complain on behalf of someone else.\n\n## If the employer refuses payment\n\nIf HMRC find that the employer has not paid they will send them a notice for the arrears plus a fine for not paying the minimum wage.\n\nHMRC can take them to court on behalf of the worker if the employer still refuses to pay.\n\n## Employment tribunal\n\nWorkers can also go directly to the [employment tribunal](/employment-tribunals/taking-a-case-to-an-employment-tribunal) themselves.\n\nWorkers who have been dismissed because of a minimum wage dispute can also complain to the employment tribunal for [unfair dismissal](/dismissal/unfair-and-constructive-dismissal).\n  *[HMRC]: HM Revenue and Customs",

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so let\u2019s talk about minimum wage stuff really quick. So like, minimum wage kinda depends on your age and if you\u2019re an apprentice, right? The National Minimum Wage is basically the minimum pay you gotta get per hour, and if you\u2019re 21 and over then you get the National Living Wage, which is like better or something. Even small employers have to pay the minimum wage. Crazy!\n\nIf you wanna see if you\u2019re getting the right minimum wage, there are these calculators you can use. Yeah, there\u2019s one for workers and another for employers. Use the workers\u2019 one to see if you\u2019re paid right or if someone owes you money from last year, which would be super annoying. And then employers can use their calculator to check if they\u2019re paying correctly too. There\u2019s even some guidance on figuring all this out for different jobs.\n\nLike, only people classed as \u2018workers\u2019 can get this minimum wage stuff, and you gotta be at least old enough to leave school to qualify for it. For the National Living Wage, like I said, you gotta be 21 or older. And guess what? If your contract says you\u2019re gonna get less than the minimum wage, that contract doesn\u2019t even count, so you still get the minimum!\n\nAnyway, some people who get minimum wage include part-timers, apprentices, casual laborers... you know, like anyone working. Except there are some exclusions, like self-employed people or company directors. Plus, if you\u2019re volunteering or doing some government employment thing, that doesn\u2019t count either. Oh, and if you\u2019re under 16, you\u2019re out too. \n\nSo, if you\u2019re an apprentice, you get paid differently and can get a lower rate if you're under 19 or in your first year, but after that, it's regular minimum wage based on your age. It\u2019s kind of a lot to remember! \n\nWhen it comes to employers, they HAVE to pay the minimum wage, or else. That\u2019s like serious business. Like, they could get in trouble for not doing it, and if they realize they owe someone back pay, they gotta pay it like, right away. There are fines and they could even get named publicly if they mess up!  \n\nSome payments don\u2019t count when you\u2019re calculating wages, like traveling costs or things workers buy for their job that they don\u2019t get paid back for\u2014like tools or uniforms, which is kinda not cool. \n\nAnd then there\u2019s this example with a guy named John, who works 40 hours a week and makes \u00a311.50 an hour. But because he pays \u00a310 a week for his uniform, he actually makes less than the minimum wage. His boss has to pay him back, which is a pain but good for John.\n\nSo if you think you\u2019re not getting paid right, you should talk to your employer first, and if that doesn\u2019t work, you can ask them to see the pay records. You can even call this ACAS helpline or complain to HMRC if needed. \n\nBasically, if your employer\u2019s still being a jerk about paying you, HMRC can fine them and get you what you\u2019re owed. And you can even go to court about it if things get really messy. \n\nIn short, minimum wage stuff is a lot, but just remember: know your rights and don\u2019t get cheated out of your hard-earned cash!",

They can affect their:\n\n  * behaviour or ability to socialise, for example they struggle to make friends\n  * reading and writing, for example because they have dyslexia\n  * ability to understand things\n  * concentration levels, for example because they have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\n  * physical ability\n\n\n\n## Who to talk to\n\nIf you think your child may have special educational needs, contact the SEN co-ordinator, or \u2018SENCO\u2019 in your child\u2019s school or nursery.\n\n[Contact your local council](/find-your-local-council) if your child is not in a school or nursery.\n\nYour local [Information, Advice and Support (IAS) Service](https://councilfordisabledchildren.org.uk/information-advice-and-support-services-network/find-your-local-ias-service/) can give you advice about SEND.\n\n## Support your child can receive\n\nYour child may be eligible for:\n\n  * [SEN support](/children-with-special-educational-needs/special-educational-needs-support) \\- support given in school, like speech therapy\n  * an [education, health and care (EHC) plan](/children-with-special-educational-needs/extra-SEN-help) \\- a plan of care for children and young people aged up to 25 who have more complex needs\n\n\n\nIf you or your child got [support before September 2014](/children-with-special-educational-needs/support-before-september-2014) this will continue until your local council changes it to an EHC plan.\n\n## Special educational needs support \n\nYour child will get SEN support at their school or college.\n\nYour child may need an [education, health and care (EHC) plan](/children-with-special-educational-needs/extra-SEN-help) if they need more support than their school provides.\n\n## Children under 5\n\nSEN support for children under 5 includes:\n\n  * a written progress check when your child is 2 years old\n  * a child health visitor carrying out a health check for your child if they\u2019re aged 2 to 3\n  * a written assessment in the summer term of your child\u2019s first year of primary school\n  * making reasonable adjustments for disabled children, like providing aids like tactile signs\n\n\n\nNurseries, playgroups and childminders registered with Ofsted follow the [Early Years Foundation Stage](/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2) (EYFS) framework. The framework makes sure that there\u2019s support in place for children with SEND.\n\nTalk to a doctor or health adviser if you think your child has SEND but they do not go to a nursery, playgroup or childminder. They\u2019ll tell you what support options are available.\n\n## Children between 5 and 15\n\nTalk to the teacher or the SEN co-ordinator (SENCO) if you think your child needs:\n\n  * a special learning programme\n  * extra help from a teacher or assistant\n  * to work in a smaller group\n  * observation in class or at break \n  * help taking part in class activities\n  * extra encouragement in their learning, for example to ask questions or to try something they find difficult\n  * help communicating with other children\n  * support with physical or personal care difficulties, for example eating, getting around school safely or using the toilet\n\n\n\n## Young people aged 16 or over in further education\n\nContact the college before your child starts further education to make sure that they can meet your child\u2019s needs.\n\nThe college and your local authority will talk to your child about the support they need.\n\n## Extra help \n\nAn education, health and care (EHC) plan is for children and young people aged up to 25 who need more support than is available through special educational needs support.\n\nEHC plans identify educational, health and social needs and set out the additional support to meet those needs.\n\n## Requesting an EHC assessment\n\nYou can ask [your local authority](/find-your-local-council) to carry out an assessment if you think your child needs an EHC plan.\n\nA young person can request an assessment themselves if they\u2019re aged 16 to 25.\n\nA request can also be made by anyone else who thinks an assessment may be necessary, including doctors, health visitors, teachers, parents and family friends.\n\nIf they decide to carry out an assessment you may be asked for:\n\n  * any reports from your child\u2019s school, nursery or childminder\n  * doctors\u2019 assessments of your child\n  * a letter from you about your child\u2019s needs\n\n\n\nThe local authority will tell you within 16 weeks whether an EHC plan is going to be made for your child.\n\n## Creating an EHC plan\n\n  1. Your local authority will create a draft EHC plan and send you a copy.\n\n  2. You have at least 15 days to comment, including if you want to ask that your child goes to a specialist needs school or specialist college.\n\n  3. Your local authority has 20 weeks from the date they receive the request for the assessment to give you the final EHC plan.\n\n\n\n\n## Disagreeing with a decision\n\nYou can challenge your local authority about:\n\n  * their decision to not carry out an assessment\n  * their decision to not create an EHC plan\n  * the special educational support in the EHC plan\n  * the school named in the EHC plan\n\n\n\nIf you cannot resolve the problem with your local authority, you can [appeal to the Special Educational Needs and Disability (SEND) Tribunal](/courts-tribunals/first-tier-tribunal-special-educational-needs-and-disability).\n\n## Personal budgets\n\nYou may be able to get a personal budget for your child if they have an EHC plan or have been told that they need one.\n\nIt allows you to have a say in how to spend the money on support for your child.\n\nThere are 3 ways you can use your personal budget. You can have:\n\n  * direct payments made into your account - you buy and manage services yourself\n  * an arrangement with your local authority or school where they hold the money for you but you still decide how to spend it (sometimes called \u2018notional arrangements\u2019)\n  * third-party arrangements - you choose someone else to manage the money for you\n\n\n\nYou can have a combination of all 3 options.\n\n## Independent support for children of all ages\n\nIndependent supporters can help you and your child through the new SEN assessment process, including:\n\n  * replacing a statement of special educational needs with a new EHC plan\n  * moving a child from a learning difficulty assessment (LDA) to an EHC plan\n\n\n\nYou can find out how to get local support through:\n\n  * [Council for Disabled Children](https://councilfordisabledchildren.org.uk/what-we-do-0/networks/information-advice-and-support-programme/how-find-and-access-support)\n  * [Information, Advice and Support Service Network](https://councilfordisabledchildren.org.uk/information-advice-and-support-services-network)\n  * your [local authority website](/find-your-local-council) and search for \u2018Local Offer\u2019\n\n## If your child got support before September 2014 \n\nYour child will move to an [education, health and care (EHC)](/children-with-special-educational-needs/extra-SEN-help) plan. This will normally happen at a planned review, or when your child moves school. Your council will tell you which.\n\nYour child will already be getting SEN support if they used to get help through:\n\n  * School Action or School Action Plus\n  * Early Years Action or Early Years Action Plus\n\n\n\n## Support after your child leaves school\n\nIf your child has a statement of special educational needs, they\u2019ll have a \u2018transition plan\u2019 drawn up in Year 9. This helps to plan for their future after they leave school.\n\nThey\u2019ll continue to get support during further education. Your child can also ask for an EHC assessment if they need more help than the school or college can provide.\n\n## Help and advice\n\nYou can call the Contact a Family helpline for help and advice.\n\n**Contact a Family helpline**  \n[helpline@cafamily.org.uk](mailto:helpline@cafamily.org.uk)   \nTelephone: 0808 808 3555   \nMonday to Friday, 9:30am to 5pm  \n[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)\n\nYou can also get help from [Independent Parental Special Education Advice (IPSEA).](http://www.ipsea.org.uk/)\n\n**IPSEA advice line**  \nTelephone: 0800 018 4016   \nMonday to Thursday, 10am to 4pm and 7pm to 9pm   \nFriday, 1pm to 4pm   \n[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)\n  *[SEND]: special educational needs and disabilities\n  *[SEN]: special educational needs\n  *[SENCO]: special educational needs co-ordinator\n  *[EHC]: education, health and care\n  *[LDA]: learning difficulty assessments\n  *[IPSEA]: Independent Parental Special Education Advice",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, like, when it comes to special educational needs and disabilities, or SEND for short, it's kinda a big deal for kids and young folks cause it can mess with how they learn, you know? I mean, it can mess with a bunch of stuff like their behavior, like how they make buddies, or if they can read and write, like if they have dyslexia or something.\n\nAlso, it might be tough for them to understand stuff or keep their focus, especially if they got ADHD, and of course, some kids might just have physical challenges too. So if, like, you think your kiddo has some of these needs, first thing you wanna do is hit up the SENCO at the school or nursery. That's like the special needs coordinator or whatever. \n\nAnd if your kid isn't in school, just call the council in your area, they should know what to do. There's also this local help thing called IAS Service that can give you guidance on SEND stuff.\n\nNow, about support - your kid could get a few things. Like, there\u2019s this SEN support which is basically help in school, you know, stuff like speech therapy or whatever, and then there\u2019s something called an EHC plan which is a bigger deal for kids up until 25 who need extra help. If your kid was getting help before, it usually keeps going until they change to an EHC plan.\n\nAt school or college, your kid will get SEN support, and if they need more than the school can do, that\u2019s when you think about an EHC plan. For the littles, under 5 years old, there are checks like when they\u2019re 2 years old, and if there's any concerns, professionals will look into it. Nurseries follow some rules to make sure they help kids with special needs, I guess.\n\nIf your child is between 5 and 15, and you\u2019re thinking they need a special learning plan or extra help with their teacher, definitely talk to the teacher. They might need to be in smaller groups or get help with talking to other kids or even just joining in on activities.\n\nAnd then, if your kiddo is over 16 and is going to college or something, it\u2019s a good idea to chat with them before school starts to see what support they\u2019ll get.\n\nNow for the EHC plans, if you think your child needs one, just ask your local authority to assess them. They can also make a request themselves if they\u2019re old enough. You might need to share some reports from school or whatever for them to see what\u2019s going on with your kid's needs.\n\nThey'll give you an answer within 16 weeks, which, like, isn\u2019t super fast but is okay, I guess. Then they draft a plan and send it to you, and you get a couple weeks to say if you want any changes or stuff.\n\nIf you disagree with something, you can challenge them on it, like if they don't want to assess or give an EHC plan. If that doesn't work, you might have to take it to court or something which is kinda wild.\n\nYou could also get a personal budget if your child has an EHC plan which is cool cause you can decide how to use that money. There are some ways to manage that money, like you can take it directly, or have the council hold it, but you tell them how to spend it.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling lost, you can contact the helpline, they\u2019re super helpful. There\u2019s also **IPSEA** which is another place you can go for advice. So yeah, navigating this whole SEND thing can be a lot, but there\u2019s help out there if you need it.",

Not the same thing at all!\n\nNormally, you can snag this grant if you check these boxes: 1) it\u2019s your first kid or you\u2019re expecting twins (lucky you!). 2) You or your partner are already getting certain benefits like income support and all that jazz.\n\nOh, and make sure to claim it within 11 weeks before the due date, or no later than 6 months after the baby pops out. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to pay this money back and it won\u2019t mess with your other benefits or tax stuff. Easy, right?\n\nSo what do you get? Like I said, it\u2019s \u00a3500, and it\u2019s yours to keep. But if you already have kids, you might not qualify, kinda lame I know.\n\nIf you do have kids under 16 and you\u2019re expecting twins or triplets, you could still be in the running for that \u00a3500\u2014or more if it\u2019s really a multiple births situation! Like, let\u2019s say you\u2019ve already got one normal kid, then it\u2019s \u00a3500 if twins show up. But if you\u2019ve had twins before? Nope, no extra cash. Confusing? A bit, but kinda straightforward.\n\nNow about how you actually get this money. It all goes straight into your bank account or building society\u2014whatever your jam is. \n\nFor eligibility\u2014most of the time, you can\u2019t have other kids under 16 kicking around. Plus, you or your partner need to be on some of those benefits I just mentioned. As for the Scots, remember you can\u2019t get this grant, you gotta go the other route.\n\nAnd if you already have some kiddos? You might still get the grant if you're in a pinches situation. Like, expectin' twins or if you\u2019re looking after someone else\u2019s kid as long as you\u2019ve been doing it right over 12-months.\n\nOh yeah, if you got special refugee status or came from Afghanistan or Ukraine, you can still qualify too for that first kid grant if you meet the requirements. \n\nAnd if you\u2019re not giving birth yourself? No worries! If you\u2019re adopting or being a surrogate, you\u2019re still in the running but the kiddo has to be under a year old when you claim. You gotta be on those benefits too and be responsible for the baby, not just hanging out.\n\nWanna claim? You can start 11 weeks before the due date or up to 6 months after the baby is out. If it\u2019s adoption or becoming responsible for a child, similar rules apply.\n\nFor claiming, print the form\u2014you can find it online. Fill it out and send it off with proof of your pregnancy or that you had the baby from a doc or midwife. You can send it without all the proof if you\u2019re in a rush, but be ready to send that later. If you\u2019re in Northern Ireland, there\u2019s a different process, so heads up on that!\n\nOnce you send it all, you'll hear back in about 28 days from the DWP about your claim results. If you\u2019ve just put in a Universal Credit claim, it might take longer, like a waiting game! If you have questions, just hit up the Sure Start Maternity Grant helpline or the Jobcentre Plus. \n\nAnd, oh! If they say no, you can try to appeal that decision, ya know? Just a heads up.",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, if you\u2019re a student and like, someone\u2019s depending on you for money, you can totally go for this thing called the Adult Dependants' Grant. It's something like, you can get up to \u00a33,438 for the year 2024-2025, which is actually kinda cool. For last year, it was \u00a33,354 or something. \n\nNow, the whole point of this grant is that you don\u2019t have to pay it back, which is sweet. It also sits on top of your other student funds, so it\u2019s like extra cash! Just bear in mind, if you get too much money and things change for you, like your courses or whatever, you might have to pay back some.\n\nOh, and heads up\u2014if you\u2019re swimming in Postgraduate Loans, then you can\u2019t snag this grant, sorry. \n\nIf you do get the grant, it\u2019s cash money that can really help, but it might mess with your benefits and tax credits, so watch for that!\n\nHow much you actually get kinda depends on a few things. Like, they look at your income, the income of the adult who\u2019s depending on you, and your personal life stuff like if you\u2019re married or got kids or whatever. Also, if you\u2019re getting other grants like the Childcare Grant, that plays into it too.\n\nWhen it comes to getting the money, they pay it out in three chunks (that\u2019s like, one chunk at the start of each term, pretty straightforward). \n\nEligibility is kinda specific too. The adult depending on you can\u2019t be any of your kids or like, someone making more than \u00a33,796 a year, and they can\u2019t be juggling their own student finance during the same year. And if you're under 25, your partner doesn\u2019t count unless you\u2019re married or in some civil partnership deal. \n\nAlso, you\u2019re out of luck if your total household income (like, yours plus whoever else lives with you) goes over \u00a315,621.98, or again, with those pesky Postgrad Loans. \n\nTo actually get this grant, you just gotta fill out the Adult Dependants' Grant part when you apply for student finance online. You\u2019ve gotta throw in some estimates about your household income too. Then, Student Finance England looks it over and will hit you up for more info if they need to. After that, they\u2019ll send you a letter to say if you\u2019re in or out and how much cash you\u2019re getting.\n\nLastly, if you\u2019re getting this grant and the adult relying on you starts getting their own student financing, definitely let Student Finance England know like, ASAP. You don\u2019t want any mix-ups with your funds, man!",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, if you\u2019re like, 19 years old or older and doing some further education stuff and kinda struggling with money, you might wanna check out Learner Support!\n\nLearner Support is this thing that can give you cash for all the necessities you need to study or go to class, but not for the course fees, obviously. So, like, it\u2019s good for a bunch of things during your course like, you know, your travel costs - like bus fares or whatever - and also place to live if you need it. You can get money for materials like books or pens, and if you need a laptop and Wi-Fi, that too. Also, if you have kids, it can help with childcare costs as long as it\u2019s with some official childcare provider that\u2019s, like, registered or something.\n\nTo get this money, you gotta apply through your learning provider \u2013 that\u2019s basically your college or school. The amount you can get? Well, that kinda just depends on your situation, no idea how they figure that out, but you\u2019ll find out.\n\nSo, what about the money? Well, your college decides how much you get and how it\u2019s gonna be handed out. They might give you a loan (which you might have to pay back, anxiety much?), or maybe just a grant, which is, like, free money you don\u2019t pay back, or they might just pay someone else directly, like the childcare people.\n\nYou should totally ask the student support peeps at your college or check out the National Careers Service site \u2018cause they might have more cash options for you.\n\nNow about who can actually go for the Learner Support: like I said, gotta be 19 or older. If you're 20, you can get money for childcare, but they don't want anyone under that age for that. You gotta be studying something at, like, level 3 or below, and you need to show that you\u2019re broke - some proof of your low income or whatever. \n\nIf you\u2019re 19 and kinda need help just for kids, there\u2019s this other thing called Care to Learn you can try. But you can also still ask for Learner Support for other stuff, like transportation.\n\nOh, and if you\u2019re getting some other kinds of funding, like Care to Learn or Disability Living Allowance, you can still apply for Learner Support too. It doesn't hurt to ask, right?\n\nBut then, there\u2019s some peeps who just can\u2019t apply, like if you\u2019re getting student loans for, like, higher education, or if you\u2019re in some Community Learning course. Oh, and if, like, the same costs are covered by the Advanced Learner Loan Bursary Fund, then nope, you can\u2019t apply for Learner Support.\n\nYou can actually get both funds if you\u2019re using them for different stuff. \n\nSo, when you're ready to apply, just hit up your learning provider directly; they have their own way of doing things, so you gotta follow that. Definitely talk to student support services too to get the lowdown on applying and what\u2019s available for you.\n\nLastly, if, like, you\u2019re not happy with the decision after applying for Learner Support, just reach out and ask your learning provider to explain or appeal it. Don\u2019t just sit there and take it!",

      "body": "## Entitlement \n\nThis guide is also available [in Welsh (Cymraeg)](/cyflogwyr-tal-absenoldeb-mamolaeth).\n\n## Statutory Maternity Leave\n\nEligible employees can take up to 52 weeks\u2019 maternity leave. The first 26 weeks is known as \u2018Ordinary Maternity Leave\u2019, the last 26 weeks as \u2018Additional Maternity Leave\u2019.\n\nThe earliest that leave can be taken is 11 weeks before the expected week of childbirth, unless the baby is born early.\n\nEmployees must take at least 2 weeks after the birth (or 4 weeks if they\u2019re a factory worker).\n\n## Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP)\n\nSMP for eligible employees can be paid for up to 39 weeks, usually as follows:\n\n  * the first 6 weeks: 90% of their average weekly earnings (AWE) before tax\n  * the remaining 33 weeks: \u00a3184.03 or 90% of their AWE (whichever is lower)\n\n\n\nTax and National Insurance need to be deducted.\n\nUse the [SMP calculator](/maternity-paternity-calculator) to work out an employee\u2019s maternity leave and pay.\n\nSome employment types like agency workers, directors and educational workers have [different rules for entitlement](/statutory-maternity-pay-how-different-employment-types-affect-what-you-pay).\n\n## Extra leave or pay\n\nYou can offer more than the statutory amounts if you have a company maternity scheme. You must make sure your maternity leave and pay policies are clear and available to staff.\n\n## Reclaiming payments\n\nEven if you pay an employee more than the statutory amount, you can usually only reclaim 92% of that amount. You may be able to reclaim 103% if you qualify for Small Employers\u2019 Relief. Read more about [reclaiming statutory pay](/recover-statutory-payments).\n\n## If the baby is born early\n\nLeave starts the day after the birth if the baby is born early.\n\nThe employee must give you the child\u2019s birth certificate or a document signed by a doctor or midwife that confirms the actual date of birth.\n\nYou must write to them confirming the new end date for their leave.\n\nFor very premature births, you\u2019ll need to calculate SMP using your payroll software (if it has this feature) or [work it out manually](/statutory-maternity-pay-manually-calculate-your-employees-payments). A very premature birth is where the child is born 15 weeks or more before the due date.\n\n## If the baby dies\n\nEmployees still qualify for leave or pay if the baby:\n\n  * is stillborn after the start of the 24th week of pregnancy\n  * dies after being born\n\n\n\n## Employment rights\n\nAn employee\u2019s [employment rights](/employee-rights-when-on-leave) (like the right to pay, holidays and returning to a job) are protected during maternity leave.\n\nYou still have to pay SMP even if you stop trading.\n\n## Eligibility and proof of pregnancy \n\nSome employees will not qualify for both leave and pay.\n\n## Statutory Maternity Leave\n\nEmployees must:\n\n  * have an [employment contract](/employment-contracts-and-conditions) \\- it does not matter how long they\u2019ve worked for you\n  * give you the [correct notice](/maternity-leave-pay-employees/notice-period)\n\n\n\n## Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP)\n\nEmployees must:\n\n  * be on your payroll in the \u2018qualifying week\u2019 - the 15th week before the expected week of childbirth\n  * give you the [correct notice](/maternity-leave-pay-employees/notice-period)\n  * give you proof they\u2019re pregnant\n  * have been [continuously employed by you](/continuous-employment-what-it-is) for at least 26 weeks up to any day in the qualifying week\n  * earn at least \u00a3123 a week (gross) in an 8-week \u2018relevant period\u2019\n\n\n\nUse the [maternity pay calculator](/maternity-paternity-calculator) to check an employee\u2019s eligibility and work out their relevant period, notice period and statutory maternity pay.\n\nThere are [special rules](/statutory-maternity-pay-employee-circumstances-that-affect-payment) for some employee situations (for example if they leave, become sick or their baby is born before the qualifying week).\n\n## Proof of pregnancy\n\nYou must get proof of the pregnancy before you pay SMP. This is usually a doctor\u2019s letter or a maternity certificate (known as an MATB1 certificate). Midwives and doctors usually issue these 20 weeks before the due date.\n\nThe employee should give you proof within 21 days of the SMP start date. You can agree to accept it later if you want.

      "poorly_written_article": "## Entitlement \n\nSo, this guide thing is also in Welsh, if you wanna check that out. \n\n## Statutory Maternity Leave \n\nAlright, listen up! If you're an eligible employee, you can take up to 52 weeks off for maternity leave, which is like a super long break, right? The first 26 weeks is called \u2018Ordinary Maternity Leave\u2019 and then there\u2019s another 26 weeks after that which is \u2018Additional Maternity Leave\u2019. Kinda pretty straightforward. \n\nYou can start this leave like, 11 weeks before the baby is due unless the little one decides to make an early appearance and crash the party. Also, employees gotta take at least 2 weeks off after the birth, or if you\u2019re working in a factory, it\u2019s 4 weeks. Like, safety first or something!  \n\n## Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP)  \n\nNow about that pay, right? If you\u2019re eligible, you can get SMP for up to 39 weeks. Here\u2019s how it usually breaks down: \n\n- First 6 weeks? You get 90% of your average weekly earnings - that\u2019s the money you usually make before they tax you. \n- Then for the next 33 weeks, you get either \u00a3184.03 or 90% of your average weekly earnings, whichever is lower. \n\nAnd, oh, don\u2019t forget, there will be tax and National Insurance stuff taken out, because of course! \n\nIf you wanna figure out specifics for an employee, there's a calculator for that online to help you out. It\u2019s super useful!  \n\nBut heads up, some jobs like agency workers or directors might have \nlike, different rules for these maternity benefits, so just keep that in mind! \n\n## Extra Leave or Pay  \n\nIf your company does more than the law says, cool, but make sure the new rules about leave and pay are clear to everyone. Just basic courtesy! \n\n## Reclaiming Payments  \n\nNow if you pay out more than the statutory amounts, you can usually get back only 92% of what you dished out. If you\u2019re one of those small employers who qualify, you might be able to reclaim 103% - lucky you! There\u2019s info about reclaiming payments online as well, so definitely check that out. \n\n## If the Baby is Born Early  \n\nSo let\u2019s say the baby decides to show up early, well, leave starts the day after the birth. Super simple, right?  Just gotta make sure the employee hands over the birth certificate or something that proves when the baby was actually born. Then you have to send them a letter telling them when their leave ends. \n\nFor babies born really prematurely (like, 15 weeks early), you gotta do some calculations for SMP using whatever payroll software you\u2019ve got or like, figure it out yourself. Not super complicated, but could take some time. \n\n## If the Baby Dies  \n\nSad but necessary to mention\u2014if the baby dies after being born or if they are stillborn after 24 weeks, the employees still get their leave and pay. Just gotta be sensitive here. \n\n## Employment Rights  \n\nWhile they\u2019re on maternity leave, their rights for stuff like pay, holidays, and getting their old job back are protected. You also gotta keep paying SMP even if your business is kinda not doing well. \n\n## Eligibility and Proof of Pregnancy  \n\nNot everyone will be able to get both leave and pay, and that\u2019s just how it is. \n\nFor Statutory Maternity Leave \n- They have to have an employment contract, and it doesn\u2019t matter how long they\u2019ve been there.  \n- They gotta tell you the correct notice, like the proper way to do it.  \n\nFor Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP)  \n- They need to be on payroll in what's called the 'qualifying week' which is basically 15 weeks before the baby\u2019s due date. \n- Again, they need to notify you and show proof they are pregnant. You\u2019d think this part\u2019s obvious but gotta say it!  \n- Also, the employee needs to have been employed with you for at least 26 weeks leading up to that qualifying week, and making at least \u00a3123 a week. No pennies! \n\nThere are specific rules for different situations too! You can check those out if you need to. \n\n## Proof of Pregnancy \n\nBefore you dish out any SMP, you gotta have proof\u2014they usually get this from a doctor or midwife around 20 weeks before the due date, called the MATB1 certificate.  \n\nIf the employee doesn\u2019t hand in their proof within 21 days of when SMP starts, you can kinda work with them but, you don\u2019t have to pay them SMP if they don\u2019t give you that proof within 13 weeks.  \n\nMake sure you're keeping records of that proof and everything.  \n\nIf they don\u2019t qualify for SMP, they could go for Maternity Allowance which is another type of help. \n\n## Notice Period  \n\nThe notice doesn\u2019t have to be in writing unless you ask for it. Just keep it chill! \n\n## Statutory Maternity Leave  \n\nAt least 15 weeks before the baby is due, employees gotta tell you when the baby is expected, and when they wanna start their maternity leave. They can change it later but need to give 28 days\u2019 notice  \n\nYou have to confirm the leave dates in writing within 28 days. \n\nIf employees wanna change when they come back to work, they just need to give you like 8 weeks\u2019 notice. Pretty simple stuff! \n\n## Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP)  \n\nEmployees need to give you 28 days\u2019 notice of when they want to start their SMP, and it usually lines up with their leave start date. \n\nIf they don\u2019t provide this notice and don\u2019t have a good reason, you can say no to Paying SMP. \n\n## Refuse Pay Form SMP1 \n\nIf they don\u2019t qualify for SMP, you gotta give them the SMP1 form within a week of your decision to refuse. They need to get that form within 28 days of either asking for SMP or the birth, whatever happens first.  \n\n## Record Keeping  \n\nKeep records for HMRC like proof of pregnancy\u2014which, remember, that MATB1 certificate is super important\u2014date SMP started, and all your payments hits and misses. \n\nHold onto those records for 3 years from the end of the tax year. You can use forms or just keep your own notes.  \n\n## Help with Statutory Pay  \n\nNeed help with statutory pay? You can: \n- reclaim payments but usually just 92%  \n- apply for an advance if you can't deal with payments right now  \n\nSo, sort of lots of stuff to know, right? But honestly, just keep it simple and check online if you\u2019re confused!",

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so let's talk about further education, or FE for short. This is basically anything you wanna study after high school but isn\u2019t, like, going for a college degree. You know, like an undergraduate or graduate program? Yeah. So, courses can be all sorts of things, from basic English and math to these fancy Higher National Diplomas, which are a big deal in their own way, I guess.\n\nSo, there\u2019s like three main types of technical and applied qualifications for kids aged like, 16 to 19: first, there are these level 3 tech levels for folks who want a specific technical job. And then you\u2019ve got level 2 tech certificates, which are cool for getting a job or moving up to a tech level or something. And lastly, there are these applied general qualifications that are for continuing your education but in a hands-on way, you know? \n\nNext, let\u2019s quickly hop over to funding. So, a lot of courses for basic skills in reading, writing, and math? Yeah, sometimes those are totally free. And if you\u2019re under 24 and going for your first qualification that\u2019s like around GCSE or A level stuff, you might not pay tuition at all. It's kinda sweet. And don\u2019t forget that you can get some financial support, which is great for covering costs for your courses or just living, you know, like eating food and stuff.\n\nWanna find a course? Use this thing called the National Careers Service course search to look for FE courses by name, school or whatever subject. You can also do distance learning like online or email classes, which is cool if you don\u2019t wanna leave your house!\n\nIf you\u2019re looking at different colleges, you can compare some survey data from employers and learners about what these FE colleges are like. It\u2019s like a Yelp for colleges, kinda? \n\nAlright, if you\u2019re a teen, like 16 or 17, you can study an FE course full-time at school or college, or even while you\u2019re working, how neat is that? Also, if you're wrapping up school or something, you'll be promised a spot in an FE course in the autumn if you're under 18. Just hit up your school or local council to see what courses are around.\n\nNow let\u2019s jump back to that advice thing. You can get free advice to pick a course from a National Careers Service adviser. They\u2019re out there to help you figure things out, which is nice. \n\nAnd when it comes to finances, you could get help covering costs for your course, living expenses, or even childcare if you've got kids! Depending on the situation and the subject, you might qualify for certain funds like Learner Support, or a Residential Support Scheme, Care to Learn, Dance and Drama Awards \u2013 yeah it sounds all fancy \u2013 or even a 16 to 19 Bursary Fund. If you\u2019re older than 19, there's this Advanced Learning Loan thing to help with college costs too. \n\nWhen looking at essential skills, don\u2019t stress too much because you probably won\u2019t have to shell out any cash for level 1 or 2 English and math courses! And sometimes other courses might be free too. Bonus!\n\nOh, and watch out if you\u2019re on benefits. If you\u2019re unemployed and getting Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance or Employment and Support Allowance, you could score free training. Just talk to your Jobcentre work coach for the scoop on available training. If you're not getting free stuff from there, you could check with colleges and training providers too.\n\nLastly, there\u2019s this thing called a Family Action grant search where you can see if a charitable trust might help you. That\u2019s pretty neat if you need it. In any case, just find out more about courses and financial support through the National Careers Service! They\u2019ve got all the info you need!",

Payments can start any time between the 11th week before your baby is due and the day after the baby is born.\n\nThis guide is also available in [Welsh (Cymraeg)](/lwfans-mamolaeth), [British Sign Language (BSL)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYPKvEpJpMg&list=PLC0aQWFFHARwkHsLhAD_iRsB_UHeruv-m) and [easy read format](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/easy-read-maternity-allowance).\n\nAny money you get can affect [your other benefits](/maternity-allowance/what-youll-get).\n\n## Eligibility \n\nYou can get Maternity Allowance for up to 39 weeks if you\u2019ve been either:\n\n  * registered as self-employed for at least 26 weeks in the 66 weeks before your baby\u2019s due\n  * employed for at least 26 weeks in the 66 weeks before your baby\u2019s due\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve been employed, you must have been earning (or classed as earning) \u00a330 a week or more in at least 13 weeks of your employment. The weeks do not have to be together.\n\nYou may still qualify if you\u2019ve recently stopped working. It does not matter if you had different jobs or periods of unemployment.\n\nYou can use the [maternity entitlement calculator](https://www.gov.uk/pay-leave-for-parents) to check your eligibility.\n\n## If you do unpaid work for your spouse or civil partner\u2019s business\n\nYou might get Maternity Allowance for up to 14 weeks if, for at least 26 weeks in the 66 weeks before your baby is due, you:\n\n  * have taken part in unpaid work for the business of your spouse or civil partner\n  * have not been employed or self-employed\n\n\n\nIn the same 26 weeks, your spouse or civil partner must:\n\n  * be registered as self-employed with HMRC\n  * pay Class 2 National Insurance contributions\n\n\n\n## If you lose the baby\n\nYou may still qualify if the baby is either:\n\n  * stillborn from the start of the 24th week of pregnancy\n  * born alive at any point during the pregnancy\n\n## What you'll get \n\nUse the [maternity entitlement calculator](https://www.gov.uk/pay-leave-for-parents) to work out how much you could get.\n\n## If you\u2019re employed or have recently stopped working\n\nYou\u2019ll get \u00a3184.03 a week or 90% of your average weekly earnings (whichever is less) for up to 39 weeks if you\u2019re employed or have recently stopped working.\n\nYou can get Maternity Allowance for up to 39 weeks. This means if you take the full 52 weeks Statutory Maternity Leave, your final 13 weeks will be unpaid.\n\n## If you\u2019re self-employed\n\nYou can get between \u00a327 to \u00a3184.03 a week for up to 39 weeks if you\u2019re self-employed.\n\nHow much you get depends on how many Class 2 National Insurance contributions you\u2019ve made in the 66 weeks before your baby is due.\n\nTo get \u00a3184.03 per week you must have:\n\n  * been registered with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) for at least 26 weeks in the 66 weeks before your baby is due\n  * paid Class 2 National Insurance contributions for at least 13 of the 66 weeks before the baby is due\n\n\n\nYou may get \u00a327 for a few weeks while your contributions are linked to your Maternity Allowance application. Your payments will be increased and backdated if necessary. This can take several weeks.\n\n### If you\u2019ve paid less than 13 weeks of contributions\n\nYour Maternity Allowance will be calculated based on how many weeks of Class 2 National Insurance contributions you\u2019ve made.\n\nIf you\u2019ve not paid any Class 2 National Insurance contributions, you\u2019ll be entitled to \u00a327 per week Maternity Allowance.\n\nYou can top-up your contributions to increase your Maternity Allowance after you apply.\n\n### Increase your Maternity Allowance\n\nAfter you apply, HMRC will contact you if you\u2019ve paid less than 13 weeks of Class 2 National Insurance. They will tell you how many additional contributions you need to get the full amount of Maternity Allowance.\n\nDepending on how many additional contributions you pay, you can get between \u00a327 and \u00a3184.03 per week for up to 39 weeks.\n\nOnce your additional contributions have been linked to your Maternity Allowance application, your payments will be increased and backdated if necessary. This can take several weeks.\n\nClass 2 National Insurance contributions are \u00a33.45 per week.\n\n## If you do unpaid work for your spouse or civil partner\u2019s business\n\nYou can get \u00a327 a week for up to 14 weeks if you do unpaid work for your spouse or civil partner\u2019s business.\n\n## How you\u2019re paid\n\nMaternity Allowance is paid every 2 or 4 weeks.\n\nAll benefits, pensions and allowances are usually [paid straight into your bank, building society or credit union account](https://www.gov.uk/how-to-have-your-benefits-paid).\n\n## Effect on other benefits\n\nWhen you claim Maternity Allowance, some of your other benefit payments may change, but your total benefit payments will usually either go up or stay the same.\n\nThe benefits affected are:\n\n  * Universal Credit\n  * bereavement benefits\n  * Carer\u2019s Allowance\n  * Carer Support Payment\n  * Council Tax Reduction\n  * Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)\n  * Housing Benefit\n  * Income Support\n  * Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA) - this will stop if you get Maternity Allowance\n\n\n\nYou may also be affected by the [benefit cap](/benefit-cap), which limits the total amount of benefit you can get. It applies to most people aged 16 or over who have not reached [State Pension age](/state-pension-age).\n\nUse a [benefits calculator](/benefits-calculators) to work out how your other benefits will be affected.\n\n### If you get Universal Credit\n\nYour Universal Credit payment will be reduced by an amount equal to your Maternity Allowance payment.\n\nYou may get an [extra amount of Universal Credit for your children](/universal-credit/what-youll-get) (whether you get Maternity Allowance or not).\n\n[Report a change on your Universal Credit account](/sign-in-universal-credit) if you start getting Maternity Allowance.\n\nWhich benefits you get will affect which [National Insurance credits](/national-insurance-credits) you\u2019re eligible for. If you get Universal Credit:\n\n  * with Maternity Allowance payments you get Class 1 National Insurance credits, which help you qualify for some other benefits and State Pension\n  * without Maternity Allowance payments you get Class 3 National Insurance credits, which count towards your State Pension only\n\n\n\n## If you\u2019ve been paid too much\n\nYou may have to repay the money if you:\n\n  * did not report a change straight away\n  * gave wrong information\n  * were overpaid by mistake\n\n\n\nFind out how to [repay the money you owe from benefit overpayment](https://www.gov.uk/benefit-overpayments).\n\n## How to claim \n\nYou can apply for Maternity Allowance once you\u2019ve been pregnant for 26 weeks. \n\nPayments can start any time between the 11th week before your baby is due and the day after the baby is born.\n\nTo get the full amount that you\u2019re entitled to, claim within 3 months of your Maternity Allowance start date.\n\nTo claim, you\u2019ll need a [Maternity Allowance (MA1) claim form](/government/publications/maternity-allowance-claim-form). You can either:\n\n  * print it and fill it in\n  * fill it in online and print it\n  * [order a form](https://secure.dwp.gov.uk/ask-for-a-maternity-allowance-claim-form/) if you cannot print it\n\n\n\nThe form has notes to help you fill it in.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to give information about your employment in the 66 weeks before your baby is due (called the \u2018Test Period\u2019). You can use the [Test period calculator](https://secure.dwp.gov.uk/check-your-maternity-allowance-dates/date-baby-due/) to work out these dates.\n\nSend your claim to the address on the form.\n\nCall [Jobcentre Plus](/contact-jobcentre-plus) to ask for alternative formats of the form, such as braille, large print or audio CD.\n\n## What to send with your claim form\n\nYou need to include other documents when you send in your claim form.\n\n### Proof of income\n\nYou need to provide original payslips as proof of income.\n\n### Proof of a due date and birth\n\nYou need to provide proof of your baby\u2019s due date, even if the baby has already been born. This could be:\n\n  * a letter from your doctor or midwife on headed paper\n  * your MATB1 certificate \u2013 this must be an original version and not a photocopy\n\n\n\nIf your baby has already been born, you also need to provide proof of that. This could be:\n\n  * a letter from your doctor or midwife on headed paper \u2013 this can be the same letter as the one proving the due date\n  * your baby\u2019s birth certificate \u2013 this must be an original version and not a photocopy\n  * your MATB1 certificate, if the section about the actual date of birth has been filled in by a doctor or midwife \u2013 this must be an original version and not a photocopy\n\n\n\n### Additional information\n\nYou may also need to provide:\n\n  * your SMP1 form, if you were refused Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) by your employer\n  * more information about your partner\u2019s self-employed business and the unpaid work you do for them, if you\u2019re applying for Maternity Allowance for up to 14 weeks\n\n\n\n## When you\u2019ll hear about your claim\n\nYou should get a decision on your claim within 20 working days.\n\nIf you\u2019re eligible, a form will be sent to you confirming your entitlement and asking you to confirm your last day of employment before leave.\n\n## If you disagree with a decision\n\nYou can [challenge a decision](/mandatory-reconsideration) about your claim. This is called asking for mandatory reconsideration.\n\n## Report a change of circumstances \n\nYou need to report changes in your circumstances that happen while you\u2019re receiving Maternity Allowance, for example if you go back to work.\n\nYour Maternity Allowance could be stopped or reduced if you do not report a change straight away. If you\u2019re paid too much you might have to pay some of the money back. You might also have to pay a \u00a350 fine.\n\nIf you deliberately do not report changes, you\u2019re committing [benefit fraud](/benefit-fraud).\n\n## Changes you need to report\n\nReport a change of circumstances if you:\n\n  * return to work (including \u2018keeping in touch days\u2019)\n  * start or stop work\n  * start a new job\n  * become entitled to Statutory Maternity Pay from your employer\n  * return to unpaid work for your spouse or civil partner\u2019s business\n  * change your address\n  * change your name\n  * change your bank details\n  * move abroad\n  * go to prison or are held in police custody\n  * no longer wish to claim Maternity Allowance\n\n\n\nIf you decide not to return to work after your Maternity Allowance has ended, you do not need to report this. Use a [benefits calculator](/benefits-calculators) to check if you can get other financial support.\n\n### Reporting \u2018keeping in touch days\u2019\n\nYou need to report any days you work for your employer while receiving Maternity Allowance. These are known as \u2018keeping in touch days\u2019.\n\nYou can take up to 10 keeping in touch days without affecting the amount of Maternity Allowance you receive.\n\n## How to report changes\n\nYou can report changes by telephone or by post.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure whether you need to report a change, you can call for advice.\n\n### Report changes by phone\n\nYou need your National Insurance number when you call.\n\nMaternity Allowance helpline  \nTelephone: 0800 169 0283  \nTextphone: 0800 169 0286  \n[Relay UK](https://www.relayuk.bt.com/) (if you cannot hear or speak on the phone): 18001 then 0800 169 0283  \nBritish Sign Language (BSL) [video relay service](https://connect.interpreterslive.co.uk/vrs?ilc=DWP) if you\u2019re on a computer - find out how to [use the service on mobile or tablet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oELNMfAvDxw)  \nMonday to Friday, 10am to 3pm  \nWelsh language: 0800 169 0296  \nMonday to Friday, 8am to 6pm  \n[Find out about call charges](https://www.gov.uk/call-charges)\n\n### Report changes by post\n\nYou need to include your National Insurance number on any letters.\n\nSend details of your changes to:\n\nDWP Maternity Allowance  \n  \nMail Handling Site A  \n  \nWolverhampton  \n  \nWV98 2GL",

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so here\u2019s the deal on Maternity Allowance, or MA for short. It\u2019s some cash you can get when you\u2019re off having a baby. You might want it if:\n\n- You work but can\u2019t get that Statutory Maternity Pay thing (SMP).\n- You\u2019re self-employed (that's like, basically working for yourself).\n- You just quit your job.\n- You do some unpaid work for your spouse or civil partner's biz and stuff.\n\nYou can score this allowance for up to 39 weeks, which is a pretty long time! You can start applying after you hit 26 weeks of pregnancy, and your payments can kick in anywhere between 11 weeks before your baby\u2019s coming and the day after they pop out. Also, they have versions of this guide in Welsh and BSL, which is cool if you need that sort of thing!\n\nNow, if you wanna know if you can actually get this MA money, here\u2019s what you need:\n\n- Been self-employed for at least 26 weeks in the 66 weeks before the baby\u2019s due.\n- Or been employed for 26 weeks in that same time.\n\nIf you worked, you gotta make or be thought to make at least \u00a330 a week in at least 13 weeks (but it doesn\u2019t matter if they weren\u2019t all in a row, so that\u2019s nice).\n\nOh, and even if you stopped working recently, you might still get it! Just check out that maternity entitlement calculator thing online to see if you can qualify.\n\nNow, if you\u2019re doing unpaid work for your partner's business, you might get MA for up to 14 weeks if you worked unpaid for at least 26 weeks in the 66 weeks before your baby\u2019s due. Your spouse or civil partner? They better be registered self-employed and paying those Class 2 National Insurance contributions.\n\nWhether you lose the baby or not, you can still qualify if they were either:\n- stillborn after the 24th week.\n- born alive at any time.\n\nAbout the dough, if you\u2019ve been employed or stopped working, you\u2019ll snag \u00a3184.03 a week or just 90% of what you usually earn, but you take whichever amount is lower. So, up to 39 weeks, but don\u2019t forget, if you take a whole year off, those last 13 weeks won\u2019t be paid (yikes!). \n\nFor self-employed peeps, you can get anywhere from \u00a327 to that \u00a3184.03 a week depending on how many National Insurance dues you've paid. Ideally, you want like, 13 weeks of those contributions in, or else it gets complicated.\n\nSo, uh, if you got paid too much by mistake, you might have to pay it back if you didn't report changes like when you went back to work or something like that, which could be a pain. Watch out for that!\n\nTo claim the Maternity Allowance, fill out that MA1 form after you\u2019re at 26 weeks pregnant. You can do it online or print it\u2014whatever works. Just make sure you don\u2019t miss that 3-month deadline from when your Maternity Allowance should start or you won\u2019t get the full amount.\n\nWhen you apply, you gotta send evidence like payslips or stuff proving when your baby\u2019s due and when they were born. They want original papers, no photocopies allowed (so annoying).\n\nYou\u2019ll hear back about your claim in like 20 days. If they say no and you think they\u2019re wrong, you can challenge that, it\u2019s called mandatory reconsideration\u2014fancy term, huh?\n\nFinally, always keep them updated on anything that changes\u2014like if you head back to work or whatever. If you don\u2019t say anything, you might get a fine or have to pay back money. Ugh, who wants that?! \n\nSo that\u2019s MA in a nutshell; good luck if you\u2019re applying, it can be a bit of a maze but it\u2019s all about getting through it!",

      "body": "## Employers and eligible staff \n\nEmployers have to provide a workplace pension scheme for eligible staff as soon as your first member of staff starts working for you (known as your \u2018duties start date\u2019).\n\n## Check you\u2019re an employer\n\nYou\u2019re usually an employer if you deduct tax and National Insurance contributions from an employee\u2019s wages.\n\n[Check you\u2019re an employer](http://www.workplacepensions.gov.uk/employer/am-i-an-employer/) if you\u2019re not sure what your pension responsibilities are, for example you employ a carer or someone to work in your home.\n\n## Who you must enrol\n\nYou must enrol and make an employer\u2019s contribution for all staff who:\n\n  * are aged between 22 and the State Pension age\n  * earn at least \u00a310,000 a year\n  * normally work in the UK (this includes people who are based in the UK but travel abroad for work)\n\n\n\nIf staff become eligible because of a change in their age or earnings, you must put them into your pension scheme and write to them within 6 weeks of the day they meet the criteria.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure what the state pension age is you can use the [State Pension age calculator](https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-age) to find out.\n\nYou do not have to enrol an employee if they give you proof of their [lifetime allowance protection](/tax-on-your-private-pension/lifetime-allowance).\n\n## How to set up a workplace pension scheme \n\nYou must set up a workplace pension scheme for eligible staff if you do not already offer one.\n\nUse The Pensions Regulator\u2019s [tool for employers](https://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/en/employers) to find out what you need to do and when you need to do it.\n\nIf you already have a workplace pension scheme that you\u2019d like to use for automatic enrolment, you must ask the provider if it meets the rules.\n\n## How much you must pay\n\nYou must pay at least 3% of your employee\u2019s \u2018qualifying earnings\u2019 into your staff\u2019s pension scheme.\n\nCheck the pension scheme you\u2019re using to find out what counts as \u2018qualifying earnings\u2019.\n\nUnder most schemes, it\u2019s the employee\u2019s total earnings between \u00a36,240 and \u00a350,270 a year before tax. Total earnings include:\n\n  * salary or wages\n  * bonuses and commission\n  * overtime\n  * statutory sick pay\n  * statutory maternity, paternity or adoption pay\n\n\n\n### Paying contributions\n\nYou must deduct contributions from your staff\u2019s pay each month. You\u2019ll need to pay these into your staff\u2019s pension scheme by the 22nd day (19th if you pay by cheque) of the next month.\n\nYou must pay your contributions for each employee by the date you\u2019ve agreed with your provider every time you run payroll. You must backdate any missed payments.\n\nYou may be fined if you pay late or do not pay the minimum contribution for each member of staff.\n\n## Manage your workplace pension scheme \n\nWhen you\u2019ve set up a workplace pension scheme, you must:\n\n  * check if and when staff should be re-enrolled\n  * manage requests to join and leave your pension scheme\n  * keep records about how you\u2019ve met your legal duties\n  * check if existing staff should be added to your pension scheme, for example when they earn a certain amount\n\n\n\n## Re-enrolment and re-declaration\n\nEvery 3 years after your first member of staff starts working for you, you must re-enrol staff into your pension scheme if they:\n\n  * left your pension scheme more than 12 months before your [re-enrolment date](http://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/en/employers/re-enrolment/choose-your-re-enrolment-date.aspx)\n  * are still in your pension scheme but pay below the minimum contributions level\n\n\n\nIf staff left your pension scheme 12 months or less before your next re-enrolment date, you can choose to re-enrol them on that date or wait until the next re-enrolment date in three years, if they\u2019re still eligible.\n\nYou must write to eligible staff within 6 weeks after your re-enrolment date to tell them you have put them back into your pension scheme.\n\nUse The Pensions Regulator\u2019s tool to [find out your dates for re-enrolment](http://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/en/employers/re-enrolment/choose-your-re-enrolment-date/find-out-your-dates-for-re-enrolment.aspx).\n\nYou must complete a [re-declaration of compliance](http://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/en/employers/re-enrolment/complete-your-re-declaration-of-compliance.aspx) every time you carry out your re-enrolment duties, even if staff were not re-enrolled.\n\nIf you do not complete the re-declaration on time you could be fined.\n\n## Requests to join or leave your pension scheme\n\nAll staff can request to join your pension scheme if they want to. You must [check they are eligible](https://www.gov.uk/workplace-pensions-employers) and put them into the scheme within 1 month of getting their request.\n\nStaff can leave your pension scheme whenever they want. You must take them out of the scheme within one month of getting their request.\n\nIf staff ask to leave your pension scheme within 1 month of joining (known as the \u2018opt-out window\u2019), you will have to refund their contributions within 1 month. If they ask to leave after the opt-out window, their contributions will be kept in their pension until they retire.\n\n## Keep records\n\nYou must keep records of how you\u2019ve met your legal duties for maintaining your pension scheme, including:\n\n  * the names and addresses of staff enrolled\n  * when contributions are paid in\n  * all requests to join or leave your pension scheme\n  * your pension scheme reference or registry number (PSR)\n\n\n\nYou must keep these records for 6 years except for requests to leave your pension scheme which must be kept for 4 years. You must also keep track of the ages and earnings of staff so you can enrol them when they become eligible.\n  *[PSR]: Pension scheme reference or registry number",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, employers gotta set up a pension scheme for their staff like, as soon as they hire someone, right? This is called when your \u2018duties start date\u2019 happens. \n\nNow, if you\u2019re confused whether you\u2019re an employer or not, it\u2019s usually if you take out tax and National Insurance from your employee\u2019s paychecks, you know? Just check if you\u2019re definitely an employer if you\u2019ve got situations like hiring a carer or someone to do your cleaning or something in your own home. \n\nOkay, so about enrolling staff. You gotta enroll and pay for folks who are:\n\n- Aged between 22 and the age they can get the State Pension.\n- Making over \u00a310,000 a year.\n- Typically working in the UK, even if they travel for work.  \n\nIf someone suddenly starts meeting the requirements due to their age or how much money they make, you gotta get them in the scheme and send them a letter in about 6 weeks, which is like, not too long, you know? If you\u2019re like, what the heck is the State Pension age, just use the State Pension age calculator thingy on the website. It\u2019s super helpful!  \n\nAlso, if an employee shows you they have some kind of lifetime allowance protection, then you don\u2019t have to enroll them. \n\nGetting a workplace pension scheme set up is kinda important if you don\u2019t already have one. You can use this tool called The Pensions Regulator\u2019s thing for employers to help you figure out the steps and when they gotta be done, \u2018cause it can get tricky, I guess. If you already have a scheme, you need to check if it\u2019s okay for automatic enrollment with your provider.  \n\nAnd when it comes to how much you have to pay into the pensions, at least 3% of their 'qualifying earnings' has to go in each month, which is basically what they make between like \u00a36,240 and \u00a350,270 a year before taxes and stuff. That counts their salary, bonuses, overtime, and even things like statutory sick pay and parental leave payments.  \n\nYou have to take the contributions from paychecks every month, and then deposit it into their pension scheme by the 22nd of the next month, or the 19th if you\u2019re doing it by check which is kinda weird. Always pay on time or you might get fined, and keep a record of what you owe each employee, otherwise, you gotta backtrack on that stuff.  \n\nOnce you\u2019ve got the workplace pension scheme up and running, it\u2019s not just over. You need to check if staff should be re-enrolled every three years or so, and you gotta manage all the requests to join or leave the scheme. Keep good records on how you\u2019ve met your legal duties, \u2019cause that's super important.\n\nNow, about re-enrollment \u2013 if someone\u2019s been out of the scheme for over 12 months, you gotta put them back in at the next date when you need to re-enroll, unless they\u2019re still in below minimum contributions, then you just sorta redo that. You have to tell 'em you've done this within 6 weeks, and there\u2019s another thing called a re-declaration of compliance you gotta do every time. Don\u2019t forget that or fines might come knocking.  \n\nAlso, all staff can ask to join, and if they want out, you gotta deal with it within a month. If they ask to leave within a month of joining, you have to refund their contributions pretty fast, but if they wait longer, their money stays in till retirement. \n\nPlus, keep records of basically everything! Who is enrolled, when are the contributions paid, any requests to join or leave, and all of that jazz for 6 years, except for leaving requests which need to be kept for only 4 years. Oh, and track their ages and earnings so you can properly enroll them when the time is right.  \n\nSo, make sure you do all that or else, y\u2019know, the pension police might come after ya.",

You cannot use this at a bank.\n\n## Pay weekly or monthly \n\nYou can set up a Budget Payment plan to make weekly or monthly Direct Debit payments towards your next Self Assessment tax bill.\n\nYour payments will be used against your next tax bill - this means you\u2019ll have less to pay at the [payment deadline](/self-assessment-tax-returns/deadlines). \n\n## Set up your Budget Payment Plan \n\nTo set up a plan you must be up to date with any payments from your last Self Assessment tax bill.\n\nSelf Assessment payments are due by the:\n\n  * 31 January for any tax you owe for the previous tax year (known as a balancing payment), and your first [payment on account](/understand-self-assessment-bill/payments-on-account)\n\n  * 31 July for your second payment on account\n\n\n\n\n### If you\u2019re up to date with your payments\n\n  1.

You must [use one of the other ways to pay](/pay-self-assessment-tax-bill) by the deadline instead.\n\n## How deductions are made\n\nThe tax you owe will be taken from your salary or pension in equal instalments over 12 months, along with your usual tax deductions.\n\n## Check your payment has been received \n\n[Sign into your HMRC online account](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/gg/sign-in?continue=/self-assessment/&origin=SA-frontend) to check if your payment has been received.\n\nAny electronic or online payments you\u2019ve sent within the last 7 days will show in the \u2018Your balance\u2019 section in your online account.

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay so like, here\u2019s the deal with paying your tax bill. You gotta pay by the 31st of January for stuff you owe from last year and also your first payment for this year. Then, there's another payment due by 31st of July. Easy peasy, right? Oh, and by the way, this info is also available in Welsh if you need it, which is kinda cool.\n\nSo, if you wanna pay your bill, you can just click on this link and boom, done. There\u2019s this HMRC app too which lets you use your bank\u2019s app to pay. Can pay in parts too if you feel like it, like wee bits at a time, which is nice. You can even set up some kind of weekly or monthly payments, or just do it through your online banking or send a cheque through the mail if you\u2019re into that old-school stuff.\n\nBut don\u2019t forget, you gotta pay on time. If not, they\u2019ll charge you interest or penalties. And the time it takes to process payments totally changes depending on how you pay. Also, you can't pay at the Post Office anymore, which is kinda sad I guess.\n\nAlright, so if you're looking for fast options, you can pay through your bank online, use some quicker banking options like Faster Payments or whatever, or just use debit or credit cards online. But if you\u2019re going to a bank, don't forget to get a special paying-in slip first. \n\nThen, there are some slower options too where it might take a few days, like cheques or Bacs, which are just kinda slow.\n\nAnd like, if you have a Direct Debit set up, it can also take a few days or longer if you're doing something new.\n\nIf there\u2019s a weekend or holiday, remember that your payment needs to reach them on the last working day before that. \n\nPayments online might be slow sometimes when it\u2019s all crazy busy, so just keep that in your mind too.\n\nSo like, if you want to set up a Direct Debit, you can do that through their online account, just make sure you know your Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) - it\u2019s basically this 10-digit number plus a letter K at the end. Super simple! \n\nYou\u2019ll also need that reference number if you're paying online or whatever, and it\u2019s super annoying if you mess it up because your payment will get delayed. \n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to pay, just head over to your banking app, sign in, and like, approve it to get the money over to them. And if you\u2019re paying multiple times, you can choose the date for each payment as long as it\u2019s before it\u2019s due. Also, if you\u2019re using Faster Payments, they usually go through right away, but for others, it could take time.\n\nNow, if you\u2019re thinking of paying with a card, there\u2019s a fee if it\u2019s a corporate card but no fee for personal debit cards. Also, for cheques, you have to make sure to write some stuff on the back and include any slips that HMRC gave you. \n\nYou could also set up a Budget Payment Plan if you're into that - monthly or weekly payments towards your tax bill. And if you can't pay, there might be ways to set up to pay bit by bit. \n\nLast thing, if you wanna pay through your tax code, you gotta meet some conditions like owing less than \u00a33,000 and stuff like that. So, yeah, check all that out. And to make sure they got your payment, just log into your online account and see if it\u2019s there. Super easy!\n\nHopefully, that clears things up, yeah?",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, like, the contribution rates for National Insurance are kinda important, right? We have this Class 1 stuff that everyone talks about. It\u2019s all about those contributions that come straight out of your paycheck (that's the employee's part) and then there's the employer's part, too. Basically, both sides are chipping in, and what you pay kinda depends on your category letter and how much cash you make. \n\nAlright, so when it comes to those rates for employees, there's this whole table thingy that shows how much gets taken from your paychecks from April 2024 to April 2025. You can check out past rates or whatever if you want but here\u2019s a taste of it:\n\nYou got categories, like A, B, C (which is kinda weird), and each one\u2019s got different brackets for earnings. It's a bit much but stick with me! \n\nCategory A, for example, you don't pay anything from \u00a3123 to \u00a3242. Then, you pay 8% on the amount above \u00a3242 and under \u00a3967 and after that, just 2% on anything over \u00a3967. So if you make \u00a31,000 in a week, you'll see deductions like, zero for the first couple hundred, then you pay like \u00a358 on the middle part, and just a tiny bit on what comes after. So yeah, it's like, total \u00a358.66 for National Insurance, which is kinda not too bad.  \n\nNow jumping over to what employers pay, there\u2019s another table for that. They have different rates too, and most of those start around the same like 0% for a bit and then shoot to about 13.8% depending on what category you\u2019re in. So employers really shell out some cash too, ya know? \n\nThen you got Class 1A and 1B stuff, which is about expenses and benefits (like if they give you a free lunch or something), and that\u2019s also taxed at 13.8%.  \n\nOh, and speaking of those category letters \u2013 most folks have category A. You can find your letter on your payslip, which is a piece of paper you get that shows what you earned and stuff. Each letter corresponds to different employee groups, like B for married women and all that jazz, while C is for people who are already past the retirement age. \n\nIt\u2019s worth noting there\u2019s categories for freeport workers and investment zone people too! Like those letters F, I, L, and S, or N, E, D, and K. Super specific, right? \n\nPlus, there\u2019s category X, which is for, like, kids who don\u2019t even have to pay National Insurance because they\u2019re under 16. And let\u2019s not forget mariners and deep sea fishermen have their own special rules, which I guess is a whole different ballgame that HMRC, the tax folks, have some info about. \n\nAnyway, there\u2019s a lot to digest with all these numbers and categories, and who knows, maybe it\u2019s a bit boring but crucial for working folks in the UK!",

This applies whether the plan is with HMRC or an independent debt collector.\n\nYou must cancel any standing orders you\u2019ve set up to repay the debt. HMRC will cancel any Direct Debits.\n\n## If you claimed tax credits as a couple\n\nThe debt will be split in half between you.

For example, they might ask a debt collection agency to collect any remaining money.\n\nYour debt may be passed to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) if HMRC cannot get the money you owe. You\u2019ll get a letter called a \u2018TC1131 (non-UC)\u2019 when this happens.\n\nYour debt will be passed to the [Department for Communities (DfC)](https://www.communities-ni.gov.uk/) if you\u2019re in Northern Ireland.\n\nYou do not need to do anything - DWP or DfC will arrange the most suitable method of recovery with you. This might be by:\n\n  * reducing your other benefits\n  * agreeing a repayment plan with you\n  * asking your employer to [take money from your earnings](/make-benefit-debt-deductions) (\u2018Direct Earnings Attachment\u2019)\n  * asking a debt collection agency to collect the money\n\n\n\n## If you start getting Universal Credit\n\nIf you start getting Universal Credit before all your debt has been recovered, DWP will usually start to [take repayments from your Universal Credit](/tax-credits-overpayments/universal-credit) to collect the remaining money.\n  *[HMRC]: HM Revenue & Customs\n  *[IBAN]: International Bank Account Number\n  *[BIC]: SWIFT Bank Identifier Code\n  *[DWP]: Department for Work and Pensions\n  *[DfC]: Department for Communities",

      "poorly_written_article": "Alright, so like, if you've been overpaid tax credits, there's a few reasons why that could have happened. Maybe something in your life changed, like your job or family stuff. Or there\u2019s a mistake from you or the HMRC, which is the tax folks in the UK. Oh, and if you don\u2019t renew your tax credits on time, that could also get you in trouble.\n\nSo, HMRC will send you a letter telling you how much you owe and how to give them their money back. If you think they messed up or if you wanna know how they figured out what you owe, just give them a bell.\n\nIf you\u2019re still getting tax credits or switched to Universal Credit, they might just take the money you owe from your future payments. But if you\u2019re not getting anything anymore and didn\u2019t go for Universal Credit, then you\u2019ll have to pay them directly. They\u2019ll get their money one way or another, trust me on that.\n\nNow, about repaying your tax credits. HMRC will drop you a letter called a \u2018notice to pay\u2019 with the details about what you owe and how to pay it back.\n\nHow you pay back depends on whether you\u2019re still getting tax credits, switched to Universal Credit, or not getting anything at all. \n\nIf you\u2019re still getting tax credits, HMRC will just cut down the amount you get until you're square with them. The amount gets reduced based on your income. If you make \u00a320,000 or less and are getting maximum tax credits, they'll take 10% of that. But if you get a little less than that, it\u2019s 25%. And if you make more than that, it's 50%. If you only get the family element of Child Tax Credits, then they\u2019ll just wipe out your payments completely.\n\nFor those who've moved on to Universal Credit, same deal \u2014 they\u2019ll just deduct from your future payments until you\u2019ve paid off what you owe.\n\nIf you\u2019re not getting tax credits or Universal Credit, you have 30 days to pay what you owe after getting that \u2018notice to pay\u2019. So, make sure your payments reach HMRC on time because if you take too long, they\u2019ll come after you.\n\nThere\u2019s a few ways to actually make payments to them:  \n1. **By Phone:**  There\u2019s an automated number you can call to make payments. You just hit the right options and give them your reference number and card details. Easy peasy.  \n2. **Direct Debit:** You can call their helpline and set up a Direct Debit, but it'll take a few days to kick in. Just have your reference number handy.  \n3. **Online or Bank Transfer:** If you\u2019re into online banking, just pay into their account using the reference number on your notice to pay. Pretty straightforward. \n4. **At the Bank:** You can pay in cash or cheque at your local bank branch. Make sure to write your reference number on the cheque or else it could cause some delays, which is a big no-no.  \n5. **By Cheque in The Post:** If you prefer mailing it, just don\u2019t fold the cheque! Send it to HMRC and give it a few days to get there.\n\nIf you need help or think HMRC got something wrong, give them a shout. \n\nIn case money's tight and you can\u2019t pay them back right away, you can ask to spread the repayment over a longer time. But they\u2019ll dig into your finances a bit to see how much you can actually pay back. \n\nSo, if you\u2019re still on tax credits and struggling, you can just use their online service or call them; they might give you more time. If you\u2019re switched to Universal Credit and can\u2019t keep up, call the Debt Management center there for assistance. \n\nJust remember, if you don\u2019t pay your debt, HMRC might pass it to DWP, and that can get messy. Plus, if you start getting Universal Credit, they might just start deducting repayments from that.\n\nIn case anyone thought it would be easy to wriggle out of repaying, it\u2019s not! They\u2019ll find you. So, yeah, keep track of your payments, and good luck!",

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so like, if you wanna take some time off for training or studying at work, there\u2019s a few things to keep in mind. First, you gotta be an employee, you know? Not just some random person. And you have to have been working there for at least 26 weeks, which is like, half a year or something. The training needs to be useful for your job too, like actually help you do better. Oh, and your workplace has to have at least 250 people in it \u2013 that\u2019s a lot, right?\n\nNow, here's a kicker: usually, you won\u2019t get paid for this time off unless your boss decides to shell out some cash for it. Just check if you\u2019re actually considered an employee first. \n\nBut there are folks who definitely cannot ask for time off to train. Like, if you\u2019re an agency worker, or in the armed forces, or if you\u2019re in that weird in-between age where you\u2019re still in school, you can't ask, sadly. Also, if you\u2019re 16 to 18 and already have to do some training or education, you're out too. \n\nSo, if you're gonna ask for time off, you gotta follow the rules at your job or just write a note to your boss or whatever. Make sure it\u2019s got a bunch of stuff in it like the date, what training you wanna do, when it is, who\u2019s teaching it, what you could get out of it, and why this will help you and the company. If you don\u2019t include all that info, your boss can totally ignore your request. Also, heads up, you can only ask for this once a year, so make it count!\n\nNow, if you decide you don\u2019t wanna do the training anymore, you totally need to tell your boss, like, right away. Whether you start it and don\u2019t finish, or switch to something else, let them know.\n\nYour boss, after you ask, has 28 days to get back to you. They can either say yes or they wanna chat with you about it. If they\u2019re busy when you ask, it might take a bit longer. And you can take a buddy to that meeting too \u2013 some co-worker or union person, you know, for support. If your buddy can\u2019t make it, you can ask to move the meeting.\n\nWhen it comes to saying no, your boss can only turn you down if it's gonna hurt the business. Like, if they think it won't help at all or they can't afford it, or if it's gonna mess up schedules and all that stuff. If they're like, 'Nope, this is gonna ruin our customer service!' then that's a legit reason. \n\nOh, and about paying for the training \u2013 your boss isn\u2019t required to pay for it. But if they think it's worth it and gonna help the business, they might decide to cover some of the costs. \n\nIf you ask and they say no, you can appeal that decision! But you gotta do it within 14 days of them saying no. Write a new letter about why you disagree, and don't forget to date it. \n\nThen, your employer has to set up a meeting with you about the appeal within 14 days, and they need to tell you their decision in writing after that. If you\u2019re still not happy after all this, you can call Acas for advice or even take it to an employment tribunal if they mess up the process or get facts wrong. Claims have to be made within 3 months of the decision, so don\u2019t sit on it too long! \n\nSo, there you go! Asking for training time off can be a bit of a hassle, but at least you\u2019ve got some routes if it doesn\u2019t go your way!",

      "body": "## Who's responsible \n\nYou\u2019re responsible for fire safety in business or other non-domestic premises if you\u2019re:\n\n  * an employer\n  * the owner\n  * the landlord\n  * an occupier\n  * anyone else with control of the premises, for example a facilities manager, building manager, managing agent or risk assessor\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re known as the \u2018responsible person\u2019. If there\u2019s more than one responsible person, you have to work together to meet your responsibilities.\n\nThe Fire Safety Order also applies if you have paying guests, for example if you run a bed and breakfast, guesthouse or let a self-catering property.\n\nFire safety rules are different [in Scotland](https://www.gov.scot/policies/fire-and-rescue/non-domestic-fire-safety/) and [Northern Ireland](https://www.nifrs.org/home/staying-safe/business-fire-safety/).\n\n## Responsibilities\n\nAs the responsible person you must:\n\n  * carry out a fire risk assessment of the premises and review it regularly\n  * tell staff or their representatives about the risks you\u2019ve identified\n  * put in place, and maintain, appropriate fire safety measures\n  * plan for an emergency\n  * provide staff information, fire safety instruction and training\n\n\n\nYou can read about [your legal duties as the person responsible for fire safety](/government/collections/fire-safety-legislation-guidance-for-those-with-legal-duties).\n\n## Non-domestic premises\n\nNon-domestic premises are:\n\n  * all workplaces and commercial premises\n  * all premises the public have access to\n  * the common areas of multi-occupied residential buildings\n\n\n\n## Shared premises\n\nIn shared premises it\u2019s likely there\u2019ll be more than one responsible person. You\u2019ll need to co-ordinate your fire safety plans to make sure people on or around the premises are safe.\n\nFor common or shared areas, the responsible person is the landlord, freeholder or managing agent.\n\n## Alterations, extensions and new buildings\n\nWhen building new premises or doing building work on existing premises, you must comply with building regulations. This includes designing fire safety into the proposed building or extension.\n\nRead the [fire safety building regulations](/government/publications/fire-safety-approved-document-b).\n\n## Penalties and enforcement\n\nYou could be fined or go to prison if you do not follow fire safety regulations.\n\nLocal fire and rescue authorities inspect premises and can issue [fire safety notices](/workplace-fire-safety-your-responsibilities/enforcement-appeals-and-penalties) telling you about changes you need to make.\n\n## Fire risk assessments \n\nAs the responsible person you must carry out and regularly review a fire risk assessment of the premises. This will identify what you need to do to prevent fire and keep people safe.\n\nYou must keep a written record of your fire risk assessment.\n\n## Carrying out the assessment\n\n  1. Identify the fire hazards.\n\n  2. Identify people at risk.\n\n  3. Evaluate, remove or reduce the risks.\n\n  4. Record your findings, prepare an emergency plan and provide training.\n\n  5. Review and update the fire risk assessment regularly.\n\n\n\n\nThe [fire safety risk assessment chart](/government/publications/fire-safety-risk-assessment-5-step-checklist) gives more detailed information about these steps.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to consider:\n\n  * emergency routes and exits\n  * fire detection and warning systems\n  * fire fighting equipment\n  * the removal or safe storage of dangerous substances\n  * an emergency fire evacuation plan\n  * the needs of vulnerable people, for example the elderly, young children or those with disabilities\n  * providing information to employees and other people on the premises\n  * staff fire safety training\n\n\n\n## Help with the assessment\n\nYou can do the fire risk assessment yourself with the help of standard fire safety risk assessment guides.\n\nIf you do not have the expertise or time to do the fire risk assessment yourself you need to appoint a \u2018competent person\u2019 to help, for example a professional risk assessor.\n\nYour local fire and rescue authority might be able to give you advice if you\u2019re not sure your risk assessment\u2019s been carried out properly. However, they cannot carry out risk assessments for you.\n\n## Assessment guides\n\nYou can download the following guides on risk assessments in:\n\n  * [offices and shops](/government/publications/fire-safety-risk-assessment-offices-and-shops)\n  * [factories and warehouses](/government/publications/fire-safety-risk-assessment-factories-and-warehouses)\n  * [sleeping accommodation](/government/publications/fire-safety-risk-assessment-sleeping-accommodation)\n  * [residential care premises](/government/publications/fire-safety-risk-assessment-residential-care-premises)\n  * [educational premises](/government/publications/fire-safety-risk-assessment-educational-premises)\n  * [small and medium places of assembly (holding 300 people or less)](/government/publications/fire-safety-risk-assessment-small-and-medium-places-of-assembly)\n  * [large places of assembly (holding more than 300 people)](/government/publications/fire-safety-risk-assessment-large-places-of-assembly)\n  * [theatres, cinemas and similar premises](/government/publications/fire-safety-risk-assessment-theatres-cinemas-and-similar-premises)\n  * [open air events and venues](/government/publications/fire-safety-risk-assessment-open-air-events-and-venues)\n  * [healthcare premises](/government/publications/fire-safety-risk-assessment-healthcare-premises)\n  * [animal premises and stables](/government/publications/fire-safety-risk-assessment-animal-premises-and-stables)\n  * [transport premises and facilities](/government/publications/fire-safety-risk-assessment-transport-premises-and-facilities)\n\n\n\nYou can also find guidance on:\n\n  * [risk assessments if you work in construction](http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/books/hsg168.htm)\n  * [purpose-built blocks of flats](http://www.local.gov.uk/fire-safety-purpose-built-flats) and [other types of housing](http://www.cieh.org/policy/fire_safety_existing_housing.html) if you\u2019re a landlord\n\n## Fire safety and evacuation plans \n\nYour plan must show how you have:\n\n  * a clear passageway to all escape routes\n  * clearly marked escape routes that are as short and direct as possible\n  * enough exits and routes for all people to escape\n  * emergency doors that open easily\n  * emergency lighting where needed\n  * training for all employees to know and use the escape routes\n  * a safe meeting point for staff\n\n\n\n## People with mobility needs\n\nYou should also make special arrangements for [people with mobility needs](/government/publications/fire-safety-risk-assessment-means-of-escape-for-disabled-people), for example make sure there are people to help wheelchair users get downstairs if there\u2019s a fire.\n\n## Fire safety equipment, drills and training \n\n## Fire detection and warning systems\n\nYou must have a fire detection and warning system. You may need different types of detectors, depending on the type of building and the work carried out in it.\n\n## Fire fighting equipment\n\nThe types of equipment you need depend on your business premises. You\u2019ll need to have any equipment properly installed, tested and maintained and train your staff to use them if necessary.\n\n### Maintenance and testing\n\nYou must carry out regular checks to make sure that:\n\n  * all fire alarm systems are working\n  * the emergency lighting is working\n  * you record any faults in systems and equipment\n  * all escape routes are clear and the floor is in good condition\n  * all fire escapes can be opened easily\n  * automatic fire doors close correctly\n  * fire exit signs are in the right place\n\n\n\n## Fire drills and training\n\nYou need to train new staff when they start work and tell all employees about any new fire risks.\n\nYou should carry out at least one fire drill per year and record the results. You must keep the results as part of your fire safety and evacuation plan.\n\n## Enforcement, appeals and penalties \n\nYour local fire and rescue authority visits premises to check the fire risk assessment and fire prevention measures are appropriate. Fire safety officers should help you understand the rules and comply with them.\n\nThey can also take action if they think your fire safety measures are not adequate. For example, they might issue an informal notice suggesting safety measures.\n\nThey could also give you a formal fire safety notice. They\u2019ll tell you how to fix the problems described in the notice.\n\n## Alterations notice\n\nYou could get an alterations notice if your premises have high safety risks or will have high safety risks if the use of the premises changes.\n\n## Enforcement notice\n\nYou could get an enforcement notice if the fire and rescue authority finds a serious risk that\u2019s not being managed. It will say what improvements are needed by when.\n\n## Prohibition notice\n\nThese take effect immediately if the fire and rescue authority thinks the fire risk is so great that access to your premises needs to be prohibited or restricted.\n\n## Appeals\n\nYou may be able to arrange an informal review from your fire and rescue authority if you disagree with the decision to issue a fire safety notice.\n\nYou can appeal to your local magistrates\u2019 court within 21 days of receiving a notice.\n\nIn certain circumstances, you and the fire and rescue authority can [ask for a \u2018determination\u2019](/government/publications/regulatory-reform-fire-safety-order-2005-guidance-note-determination-request-process) from the Home Secretary to resolve a dispute.\n\n## Penalties\n\nYou could be fined or go to prison if you do not follow fire safety regulations.\n\nMinor penalties can be up to \u00a35,000. Major penalties can have unlimited fines and up to 2 years in prison.",

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so here's the deal with fire safety, right? If you own a business or you're involved in any premises that aren\u2019t just, like, a home, you're kinda responsible for fire safety stuff. Like if you're an employer, a landlord, or even a facilities manager. They call you the 'responsible person' or something fancy like that. If there are a bunch of you, you gotta figure it all out together. \n\nAlso, if you have people staying over like for a bed and breakfast, guess what? Fire safety rules apply to you too! Oh, and just a heads-up, if you're in Scotland or Northern Ireland, the rules are kinda different, so check that out.\n\nNow about your responsibilities\u2014here\u2019s what you gotta do as the responsible person:\n- First off, you need to do a fire risk assessment, which is basically checking for fire hazards and stuff. Also, don\u2019t forget to check it every now and then. \n- Then, tell your employees (or their representatives) about what you find out. You know, like the risks.\n- You should have appropriate fire safety measures in place. Just saying, you can\u2019t skip this one.\n- Also, plan for emergencies because, like, you never know when a fire might break out.\n- And give your staff some info and training about fire safety. \n\nYou can find extra info about what you\u2019re legally supposed to do somewhere online or whatever.\n\nNow, non-domestic premises are basically any kind of workspaces, shops, or places where people go for stuff. Like, if the public can get in there, you gotta think about fire safety too. The common areas of buildings where people live but aren\u2019t owned by one person? Yeah, those count too.\n\nIf everyone\u2019s sharing a space, then you might have to work together on fire safety plans. Pretty important to keep the people on-site safe!\n\nWhen you\u2019re building something new or renovating, don't forget to follow building regulations that include fire safety stuff. \n\nIf you ignore the fire safety rules, you could get a hefty fine or even end up in jail! Local fire departments check places and can give you notices if you need to make changes. \n\nDoing a fire risk assessment is super important, and you gotta keep a written record of it too. \n\nWanna know how to do the assessment?\n1. Identify the fire hazards, duh.\n2. Figure out who's at risk. \n3. Evaluate the risks and try to fix or get rid of them.\n4. Write down what you found, make an emergency plan, and train your folks. \n5. Regularly review what you've done. \n\nThere\u2019s a chart thingy online that explains this better, look for it. You need to think about emergency exits, fire alarms, and all that jazz, plus if people have special needs.\n\nYou can totally do the assessment yourself if you want, but if you're busy or don\u2019t know much about it, hire a pro. Your local fire authority might help out if you need advice, but they won\u2019t do the assessment for you, that\u2019s on you!\n\nYou can grab some guides for risk assessments based on places like offices, factories, and even theaters online. Very handy.\n\nYour fire safety plan should include clearly marked escape routes and enough exits for everyone. Plus, make sure emergency doors work. \n\nDon\u2019t forget about people who might have trouble escaping, like those in wheelchairs. Have a plan to help them get out.\n\nYou gotta have fire detection systems and maybe different kinds of alarms depending on the place you run, so keep that in mind.\n\nAll fire safety equipment needs to be in good shape, tested and maintained. Train your staff on how to use it too! \n\nRegular checks? Yep, you need to do those to ensure alarms and exits work. And if not, you gotta fix that, pronto! \n\nDo fire drills at least once a year; record it because, you know, paperwork. \n\nFire departments come and check your fire risk assessment and see if you\u2019re keeping things safe. If they see you're slacking, they might give you a notice on what you need to improve. Like, they could even say \"Fix this by such and such date\" or \"We\u2019re not letting anyone in until you sort this out\" if things are really bad. \n\nIf that happens and you think it\u2019s unfair, you can try to get it reviewed informally or even appeal in court within 21 days. Crazy, right? \n\nBe careful, though\u2014if you don\u2019t comply, the penalties can really rack up, from fines to jail time. We\u2019re talking up to two years behind bars for serious stuff. Just remember - fire safety isn\u2019t just important; it can literally save lives.",

      "body": "## Overview \n\nYour employees may be [eligible for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP)](/sick-leave-pay-employees/eligibility-and-form-ssp1), which is [\u00a3116.75 a week](/sick-leave-pay-employees/entitlement) for up to 28 weeks.\n\nThis guide is also available [in Welsh (Cymraeg)](/tal-salwch-statudol-arweiniad-i-gyflogwyr).\n\nYou can offer more if you have a company sick pay scheme but you cannot offer less. Company schemes are also called \u2018contractual\u2019 or \u2018occupational\u2019 sick pay and must be included in an employment contract.\n\nThere\u2019s a separate guide to [Statutory Sick Pay if you\u2019re an employee](/statutory-sick-pay).\n\n## Holiday (or \u2018annual leave\u2019)\n\nStatutory [annual leave](/holiday-entitlement-rights) is accrued while the employee is off work sick (no matter how long they\u2019re off) and can be taken during sick leave.\n\n## Entitlement \n\nThe weekly rate for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) is \u00a3116.75 for up to 28 weeks. It is paid:\n\n  * for the days an employee normally works - called \u2018qualifying days\u2019\n  * in the same way as wages, for example on the normal payday, deducting tax and National insurance\n\n\n\nUse the [SSP calculator](/calculate-statutory-sick-pay) to work out the actual amount, for example for a daily rate.\n\nSome employment types like agency workers, directors and educational workers have [different rules for entitlement](/statutory-sick-pay-how-different-employment-types-affect-what-you-pay). You may still have to pay SSP even if you [stop trading](/statutory-sick-pay-business-changes-that-affect-payment#you-cease-to-trade).\n\nYou cannot force your employees to take annual leave when they\u2019re eligible for sick leave.\n\n## When to start paying SSP\n\nSSP is paid when the employee is sick for more than 3 days in a row (including non-working days).\n\nYou cannot count a day as a sick day if an employee has worked for a minute or more before they go home sick.\n\nIf an employee works a shift that ends the day after it started and becomes sick during the shift or after it has finished, the second day will count as a sick day.\n\nYou do not pay an employee SSP for the first 3 working days they\u2019re off sick unless both of the following apply:\n\n  * you\u2019ve paid them SSP within the last 8 weeks\n  * you did not pay them SSP for the first 3 working days at that time\n\n\n\n## When to stop paying SSP\n\nSSP stops when the employee comes back to work or no longer [qualifies for it](/sick-leave-pay-employees/eligibility-and-form-ssp1).\n\n## Record keeping\n\nYou do not need to keep records of SSP paid to employees.\n\nYou can choose how you keep records of your employees\u2019 sickness absence. HMRC may need to see these records if there\u2019s a dispute over payment of SSP.\n\n## Eligibility and form SSP1 \n\nTo qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) employees must:\n\n  * have an [employment contract](/employment-contracts-and-conditions)\n  * have done some work under their contract\n  * have been sick for more than 3 days in a row (including non-working days) - known as a \u2018period of incapacity for work\u2019\n  * earn an average of at least \u00a3123 per week\n  * give you [notice and proof of illness](/employers-sick-pay/notice-and-fit-notes) when needed\n\n\n\nEmployees who have been paid less than 8 weeks of earnings still qualify for SSP. Use the [sick pay calculator](/calculate-statutory-sick-pay) to work out how much to pay them.\n\nAn employee\u2019s period of incapacity for work is not interrupted if they take [annual leave](/holiday-entitlement-rights) during that time.\n\nEmployees can qualify for sick pay from more than one job.\n\nThey could also qualify in one job but be fit for work in another, for example if one job is physical work that they cannot do while ill but the other is office-based.\n\n## Exceptions\n\nEmployees do not qualify for SSP if they:\n\n  * have received the maximum amount of SSP (28 weeks)\n  * are getting Statutory Maternity Pay or Maternity Allowance - there are [special rules](/statutory-sick-pay-employee-circumstances-that-affect-payment#your-employee-is-pregnant) for pregnant women and new mothers who do not get these payments\n  * are off work for a pregnancy-related illness in the 4 weeks before the week (Sunday to Saturday) that their baby is due\n  * were in custody or [on strike](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/statutory-sick-pay-employee-circumstances-that-affect-payment#your-employee-is-involved-in-a-trade-dispute-with-you) on the first day of sickness (including any linked periods)\n  * are working outside the EU and you\u2019re not liable for their National Insurance contributions\n  * received Employment and Support Allowance within 12 weeks of starting or returning to work for you\n\n\n\nUse the [SSP calculator](/calculate-statutory-sick-pay) to check eligibility.\n\n### Linked periods of sickness\n\nIf your employee has regular periods of sickness, they may count as \u2018linked\u2019. To be linked, the periods must:\n\n  * last more than 3 days each\n  * be 8 weeks or less apart\n\n\n\nYour employee is no longer eligible for SSP if they have a continuous series of linked periods that lasts more than 3 years.\n\n## If an employee is not eligible or their SSP ends\n\nEmployees may be able to apply for [Universal Credit](/universal-credit) or [Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)](/employment-support-allowance). They use [form SSP1](/government/publications/statutory-sick-pay-employee-not-entitled-form-for-employers) to support their application.\n\nIf your employee\u2019s SSP is ending you must send them form SSP1 either:\n\n  * within 7 days of their SSP ending, if it ends unexpectedly while they\u2019re still sick\n  * on or before the beginning of the 23rd week, if their SSP is expected to end before their sickness does\n\n\n\nIf your employee does not qualify for SSP you must send them form SSP1 within 7 days of their first day off sick.\n\nIf your employee thinks this is unfair, they can appeal to HMRC \\- the form tells them how to do this.\n\n## Long-term illness\n\nYou can complete [form SSP1](/government/publications/statutory-sick-pay-employee-not-entitled-form-for-employers) before the end of SSP if you know an employee will be off sick for more than 28 weeks. This means they can apply for ESA before their SSP comes to an end.\n\n## Notice and fit notes \n\nThe employee should tell you they\u2019re sick within the time limit set by you, or 7 days if you do not have one. You cannot insist they tell you in person or on a special form.\n\nYou do not have to pay Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) for any days the employee was late in telling you (unless there\u2019s a good reason for the delay).\n\nExample\n\nAn employee is sick from Monday 3 June. They usually work from Monday to Friday.\n\nYou\u2019ve set your time limit at 5 days\u2019 notice, but they only tell you they\u2019re sick after 7 days (on Monday 10 June).\n\nYou do not have to pay them SSP for the 2 days they were late telling you.\n\nYou [start paying SSP](/employers-sick-pay/entitlement) on Thursday 13 June - on the fourth \u2018qualifying day\u2019 (days an employee usually works on) after they told you they were sick.\n\n## Fit notes and asking for proof\n\nYou can only ask for a fit note if your employee is off work for more than 7 days in a row (including non-working days).\n\nYou cannot withhold SSP if the employee is late sending you a fit note.\n\nIf your employee is off sick frequently or for a long time, HMRC has information about [getting medical advice](/statutory-sick-pay-employee-fitness-to-work).\n\n### Fit notes\n\nA fit note (sometimes called a sick note) must be issued by one of the following healthcare professionals:\n\n  * GP or hospital doctor\n\n  * registered nurse\n\n  * occupational therapist\n\n  * pharmacist\n\n  * physiotherapist\n\n\n\n\nThe note can be printed or digital.\n\n### Other proof of sickness\n\nIf you agree, the employee can give you a similar document from a physiotherapist, podiatrist or occupational therapist instead of a fit note. This is called an Allied Health Professional (AHP) Health and Work Report.\n\n## Help with sick pay \n\n## If you\u2019re insolvent\n\nHMRC will pay SSP for any employee who continues to work for you if they were sick when you became insolvent. Tell your employee to contact the Statutory Payment Disputes Team.\n\nStatutory Payment Disputes Team   \nTelephone: 03000 560 630   \n[Find out about call charges](/call-charges).\n\nIf their sickness continues and you terminate their contract, give them a completed [SSP1 form](/government/publications/statutory-sick-pay-employee-not-entitled-form-for-employers) so they can claim Employment and Support Allowance instead.\n  *[SSP]: Statutory Sick Pay\n  *[HMRC]: HM Revenue and Customs\n  *[ESA]: Employment and Support Allowance",

      "poorly_written_article": "So like, if you have employees, they might be able to get this thing called Statutory Sick Pay (SSP), which is basically \u00a3116.75 a week for, like, up to 28 weeks or something like that. There's also a Welsh version of this guide if you're into that kinda thing. \n\nNow, if you\u2019ve got your own sick pay scheme at your company, you can totally give them more, but you can\u2019t give them less. Those company schemes are called like, \u2018contractual\u2019 or \u2018occupational\u2019 sick pay or whatever. Oh, and you gotta mention it in their employment contract, so don\u2019t forget that! \n\nThere\u2019s another guide specifically for employees about SSP, but this one is for the bosses - so pay attention! \n\nNow, about holiday time, or what they call \u201cannual leave.\u201d Employees still build up their holiday days while they\u2019re out sick, no matter how long they\u2019re sick, and they can use those holiday days even if they\u2019re also on sick leave. \n\nTalking about entitlement, you pay that SSP at \u00a3116.75 for those 28 weeks like I said, and you\u2019re supposed to pay it for the days they normally work, which is a fancy way of saying their \u2018qualifying days\u2019. And you pay it like regular wages, so they get it on their payday and you take out the tax and National Insurance and stuff. \n\nThere\u2019s this handy SSP calculator you can use to figure out how much they actually get, like, if you need to do math or whatever. Oh, and heads-up, if they\u2019re agency workers or something, the rules can change a bit. You might still have to pay it even if you stop running your business, so keep that in mind. \n\nYou can't make your employees take their holiday leave while they\u2019re sick, though, just a little side note. \n\nSo, when do you start paying that sick pay? Well, you only start paying it after the employee is sick for more than 3 days in a row - that counts weekends too. But hold up, if they work just one minute and then go home because they feel sick, that day is not counted as a sick day. If they work a full shift and then get sick, though, the next day after that counts.\n\nYou won\u2019t pay the SSP for the first three working days they\u2019re out sick unless you\u2019ve already paid them SSP in the last 8 weeks, and you didn't pay for the first three days back then. \n\nThen, once the employee is back at work or doesn\u2019t qualify for SSP anymore, you stop paying it. Easy as that. \n\nOh, and guess what? You don't even need to keep records of how much SSP you\u2019ve paid. But you should keep some kind of record of sickness, just in case HMRC wants to check it later. \n\nEmployees need to meet a bunch of stuff to qualify for SSP: they need a contract, they should\u2019ve done some work, be sick for over three days, earn over \u00a3123 a week, and, like, inform you about their illness when they need to. You know, basic stuff. \n\nIf an employee is sick from different jobs, they could still get sick pay from you, which is kinda interesting. But if they\u2019re pregnant or have been in jail or on strike on the first day they get sick, they might not get it. \n\nIf they have linked periods of sickness that are over 3 days and less than 8 weeks apart, they can count those together. But if they keep being sick for over 3 years straight, they won\u2019t get SSP anymore.  \n\nAnd if their SSP is ending, you gotta send them this form called SSP1 to help them apply for help - either within 7 days of their SSP ending or when it\u2019s expected to end. \n\nSo, if someone is sick for way too long, you can fill out the form for them before their SSP runs out. Now, the employee should let you know they\u2019re sick in whatever timeframe you set, or it\u2019s seven days if you didn\u2019t set anything. If they tell you late, you don\u2019t have to pay them for those days they were late. \n\nLastly, if they\u2019re sick for over 7 days, then you can ask for a fit note, which is just proof from their doctor or a healthcare professional. It can be printed or digital, no biggie. But if they're like sick all the time, you might want to check out the HMRC info on that.\n\nSo, there you go. If anything goes wrong, like if you\u2019re bankrupt or something, tell your employee to reach out to HMRC for help. You just gotta take care of the paperwork, and everything should be cool!",

      "poorly_written_article": "# Entitlement Stuff\n\nSo, when an employee goes on leave to, like, adopt a kid or go through surrogacy, they might get this thing called Statutory Adoption Pay and Leave. \n\nOh, and if you need it, this guide is in Welsh, but I mean, let\u2019s be honest, who reads that, right? \n\n## Statutory Adoption Leave\n\nEmployees can take, like, up to 52 weeks off. The first 26 weeks is called \u2018Ordinary Adoption Leave\u2019 (super fancy name), and the other 26 weeks is \u2018Additional Adoption Leave\u2019 \u2013 just a lot of leave, honestly. \n\nYou can do this leave stuff starting when:\n\n- The kid moves in with them or up to 14 days before they expect that to happen (UK adoptions, obviously)\n- When they get matched with a child to adopt through a UK agency (so important)\n- For overseas adoptions, when the kid arrives in the UK or, like, 28 days after that\n- And for surrogacy, it could be the day the baby is born or the next day. \n\nSo, that\u2019s a lot of ways to kick off the leave, huh?\n\n## Statutory Adoption Pay\n\nNow onto money stuff. Statutory Adoption Pay is kind of a deal. Employees get:\n\n- 90% of their salary for the first 6 weeks (nice!)\n- Then it goes down to a flat rate of \u00a3184.03 per week or 90% of their pay, whichever is less, for the next 33 weeks.\n\nBut, remember, they gotta take out tax and National Insurance \u2013 bummer!\n\nYou can figure all this out using some maternity and paternity calculator online or whatever.\n\nSome jobs like agency workers and educators might have different rules. Like, one size doesn\u2019t fit all, you know? \n\n## Extra Leave or Pay\n\nSo, if you\u2019re a nice employer, you can give more leave or pay than required by law if you have a company plan. Just make sure everyone knows the rules, or you might have problems!\n\n## Reclaiming Payments\n\nEven if you\u2019re cool and pay more than the basic amount, you can usually just get back about 92% of what you gave them. If you\u2019re a Small Employer, then maybe you can reclaim 103% \u2013 like, score!\n\n## Employment Rights\n\nDon\u2019t forget, during adoption leave, employees keep their rights like wages, holidays, and getting their job back. You still gotta pay SAP even if you stop being a business. \n\n## Who Doesn\u2019t Qualify\n\nNot everyone can get the leave or the pay. If someone becomes like a special guardian or adopts a family member, they\u2019re out of luck.  \n\n## Notice Periods\n\nEmployees need to give you a heads up about their leave, like, 28 days beforehand unless it\u2019s, like, super quick with the matching process.\n\nOh, and for overseas adoption, they need to inform you when the child is expected to touch down in the UK. Simple enough!\n\n## Changes to Leave Dates\n\nIf they want to switch their leave dates, they gotta inform you 28 days ahead of their original plans. Fair warning, you know?  \n\n## Proof of Adoption\n\nThey gotta show you proof to get that sweet SAP. Doesn\u2019t have to show proof for just taking leave unless you really feel like it. \n\nIt should say stuff like, who the agency is, what date they matched, and when the kid\u2019s supposed to come live with them. \n\n## Surrogacy Arrangements\n\nFor surrogacy, they don\u2019t need proof unless you ask for it. Then they have to give some sort of statement confirming their plans for the baby.\n\n## Refusing Leave or Pay\n\nCan\u2019t say no to adoption leave. You can, however, delay it if they don\u2019t give you enough notice. \n\nYou can deny SAP if they don\u2019t meet the requirements. Just give them that form SAP1 if you say no.\n\n## Record Keeping\n\nYou gotta keep all kinds of records for HMRC, including adoption proofs and dates you started payments. Keep it for about 3 years or something like that.\n\n## Help with Statutory Pay\n\nNow, if you need financial help with this pay, you can typically reclaim about 92% and maybe ask for an advance if funds are low.\n\nSo, there you go, that\u2019s it! Lots of rules and stuff, but it\u2019s about adopting kids, which is kinda nice overall.",

This includes if the statutory leave is for another child.\n\nIf an employee\u2019s Parental Bereavement Leave is interrupted by the start of another type of statutory leave, they can take their remaining entitlement to Parental Bereavement Leave after that other leave has ended.\n\nThe remaining Parental Bereavement Leave must still be taken within 56 weeks of the date of death or stillbirth.\n\nParental Bereavement Leave can be taken between blocks of shared parental leave which had already been booked when the child died, even if the shared parental leave is for another child.\n\n## Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay\n\nStatutory Parental Bereavement Pay for an eligible employee is either \u00a3184.03 a week or 90% of their average weekly earnings (whichever is lower). Tax and National Insurance need to be deducted.\n\nCalculate an employee\u2019s Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay using [Basic PAYE tools](/basic-paye-tools) or [guidance on manual calculation](/guidance/manually-calculate-your-employees-statutory-parental-bereavement-pay).\n\nSome employment types, like agency workers, directors and educational workers, have [different rules for entitlement](/guidance/how-different-employment-types-affect-what-you-pay-in-statutory-parental-bereavement-pay).\n\n## Extra leave or pay\n\nYou can offer more than the statutory amounts if you have a company scheme for parental bereavement leave and pay. You must make sure your scheme\u2019s policies are clear and available to staff.\n\n## Reclaiming payments\n\nEven if you pay an employee more than the statutory amount, you can usually only reclaim 92% of that amount. You may be able to reclaim 103% if you qualify for Small Employers\u2019 Relief. Read more about [reclaiming statutory pay](/recover-statutory-payments).\n\n## Employment rights\n\nAn [employee\u2019s rights](/employee-rights-when-on-leave) (like the right to pay rises, holidays and returning to a job) are protected during Parental Bereavement Leave.\n\nYou still have to pay Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay even if you stop trading.\n\n## Eligibility \n\nTo qualify for Parental Bereavement Leave and Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay, an employee must meet the criteria both as a parent (including if they had day to day responsibility) and an employee. They might not be eligible for both.\n\n## If the employee was the child\u2019s parent or the parent\u2019s partner\n\nAn employee will be eligible if, at the time of the child\u2019s death or stillbirth, they were:\n\n  * the child\u2019s or baby\u2019s parent - either biological, adoptive or parent of a child born to a surrogate\n  * the partner of the child\u2019s or baby\u2019s parent\n\n\n\nBiological parents are not eligible once an adoption or parental order has been made unless there was a contact order in place after the adoption.\n\n### If the employee was not the child\u2019s parent but had day to day responsibility for the child\n\nAn employee may be eligible if they or their partner had:\n\n  * the child or baby living with them at their home for 4 continuous weeks, ending with the date of the death\n  * day to day responsibility for the child or baby\u2019s care during that time\n\n\n\nIf the employee or their partner was paid to look after the child, they\u2019re not entitled to leave or pay unless they were:\n\n  * a foster parent paid a fee or allowance by a local council\n  * reimbursed for expenses to do with the care of the child or baby\n  * getting payments under the terms of a will or trust for the child or baby\u2019s care\n\n\n\nAn employee is not eligible if one of the child or baby\u2019s parents or someone who had [parental responsibility](/parental-rights-responsibilities) ([parental responsibilities in Scotland](https://www.mygov.scot/parental-responsibilities-rights/)) for the child was also living in the household.\n\n### If the employee was an adoptive parent\n\nIf they or their partner was an adoptive parent, an employee is eligible:\n\n  * after the [adoption order](/child-adoption/applying-for-an-adoption-court-order) was granted\n  * before the adoption order was granted, if the child was placed with them for adoption and the placement was not disrupted (for example, being temporarily placed elsewhere) or stopped\n\n\n\n### If the employee was an adoptive parent of a child from outside the United Kingdom\n\nIf the employee or their partner was adopting a child from outside the United Kingdom and the court order had not yet been made, they may still be eligible. Both of the following must apply:\n\n  * the child was living with them after entering the United Kingdom\n  * they have the \u2018official notification\u2019 confirming they were allowed to adopt\n\n\n\n### If the employee had a baby with the help of a surrogate parent\n\nIf they or their partner were a parent of a child born to a surrogate, an employee is eligible:\n\n  * after a parental order was made\n  * before a parental order was made if they had applied or intended to apply for a parental order within 6 months of the child\u2019s birth and expected it to be granted\n\n\n\n## Parental Bereavement Leave\n\nTo get Parental Bereavement Leave, the employee must also:\n\n  * be [classed as an employee](/employment-status/employee) \\- it does not matter how long they\u2019ve worked for you\n  * give you the [correct notice](/employers-parental-bereavement-pay-leave/notice-period) for Parental Bereavement Leave\n\n\n\n## Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay\n\nTo get Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay, the employee must have been [continuously employed by you](/continuous-employment-what-it-is) for at least 26 weeks up to the end of the \u2018relevant week\u2019. The \u2018relevant week\u2019 is the week (ending with a Saturday) immediately before the week of the death or stillbirth.\n\nThey must also:\n\n  * remain employed by you up to the day the child dies or is stillborn\n  * earn on average \u00a3123 a week (gross)\n  * give you the [correct notice](/employers-parental-bereavement-pay-leave/notice-period) for Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay\n\n\n\nUse the [guidance on manual calculation](/guidance/manually-calculate-your-employees-statutory-parental-bereavement-pay) to check entitlement and to work out the relevant week.\n\nThere are [special rules](/guidance/employee-circumstances-that-affect-payment-of-statutory-parental-bereavement-pay) for some employee situations, for example if they leave or become sick.\n\n## Notice period \n\nAn employee must give notice for Parental Bereavement Leave as well as evidence for Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay.\n\n## Parental Bereavement Leave\n\nAn employee has 56 weeks to take Parental Bereavement Leave. This starts from the date of the child\u2019s death.\n\nThe 56 weeks is split into 2 periods:\n\n  * from the date of the death or stillbirth to 8 weeks after\n  * 9 to 56 weeks after the date of the death or stillbirth\n\n\n\nThey can take 2 weeks\u2019 leave in one block or as 2 separate blocks of one week.\n\nYou must get notice from the employee before they take Parental Bereavement Leave. How much notice depends on when they\u2019re taking leave.\n\n### 0 to 8 weeks after the child\u2019s death or stillbirth\n\nAn employee must give you notice before the time they would normally start work on the first day of the period they want to take off work.\n\n### 9 to 56 weeks after the child\u2019s death or stillbirth\n\nAn employee must give you at least one week\u2019s notice before the start of the week or weeks they want to take off work.\n\n### How employees should give you notice\n\nThey should tell you:\n\n  * the date of the child\u2019s death or stillbirth\n  * when they want their Parental Bereavement Leave to begin\n  * how much leave they are taking - either 1 or 2 weeks\n\n\n\nAn employee can give you notice informally, for example by phone, text message or email.\n\nYou cannot ask for:\n\n  * notice for leave in writing (such as following up with an email, letter or form)\n  * notice to cancel leave in writing\n  * evidence of entitlement for leave\n  * details about the employee\u2019s relationship to the child or baby\n\n\n\n### Cancelling Parental Bereavement Leave\n\nAn employee can cancel their Parental Bereavement Leave if they\u2019ve given you more than the required notice for taking leave.\n\nIf they were starting the leave within 8 weeks of the death or stillbirth, they must let you know about the cancellation no later than the time they would normally start work on the first day of planned leave.\n\nIf they were starting the leave 9 weeks or later after the death or stillbirth, they must let you know no later than one week before the start of the planned leave.\n\nThey can rebook another week\u2019s leave if they cancel before the leave was due to start and they give you the correct notice.\n\n## Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay\n\nAn employee must ask for Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay within 28 days, starting with the first day of the week they want to claim pay for.\n\nThey must give you in writing (for example, a letter or email) each time:\n\n  * the dates of the period the want to claim Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay\n  * their name\n  * the date of the child\u2019s death or stillbirth\n\n\n\nThe employee will also need to give you a self declaration to confirm they are [eligible because of their relationship to the child or baby](/employers-parental-bereavement-pay-leave/eligibility) \\- they only need to provide this once when they first ask for pay.\n\n### Cancelling Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay\n\nAn employee can cancel their Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay if they\u2019ve given you more than the required notice for claiming pay.\n\nIf their pay was due to start within 8 weeks of the child\u2019s death or stillbirth, they must give you notice on the first day of the week of pay they want to cancel.\n\nIf their pay was due to start 9 weeks or later after the child\u2019s death or stillbirth, they must tell you they want to cancel one week before their pay was due to start.\n\n## Non-payment form \n\nYou can refuse Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay if the employee does not qualify.\n\nTo do this, send them a completed [non-payment form (SPBP1)](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/submissions/new-form/tell-employee-not-eligible-statutory-parental-bereavement-pay) or your own equivalent form within 28 days of their pay request with evidence. You should keep a record of the week which was refused and the reason why.\n\nIf an employee is unhappy with your decision, they can [contact the HMRC Statutory Payments Disputes Team](/guidance/statutory-pay-entitlement-how-to-deal-with-disagreements). They must do this within 6 months of the start date of the Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay period they claimed.\n\n## Record keeping \n\nYou must keep records for HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), including:\n\n  * the start date for any period Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay was paid\n  * the payments you\u2019ve made (including dates)\n  * a copy of the evidence of entitlement from the employee for Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay including their written declaration, name and date of the child\u2019s death or stillbirth\n  * details of any weeks the employee claimed Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay but you did not pay and the reason why\n\n\n\nYou must keep records for 3 years from the end of the tax year they relate to.\n\nYou can use HMRC\u2019s [record keeping form (SPBP2)](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/submissions/new-form/record-claims-statutory-parental-bereavement-pay) or your own.\n\n## Get help with statutory pay \n\nFor financial help with statutory pay, you can:\n\n  * [reclaim payments](/recover-statutory-payments)\n  * apply for an advance if you cannot afford payments\n\n\n\n## Apply for an advance if you cannot afford payments\n\nYou can apply online for an advance to pay for an employee\u2019s Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay.\n\n[Contact HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)](/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/employer-enquiries) if you\u2019ve got questions about advance payments.\n\nBefore you start, you\u2019ll need:\n\n  * your employer PAYE reference\n  * your payment or account office reference numbers - this is on the letter when you first registered as an employer\n  * the amount of tax or National Insurance owed to HMRC\n  * bank or building society details for you or the third party it\u2019s being paid to\n  * a completed [R38 form](/government/publications/income-tax-tax-claim-r38) if the advance is being paid to a third party\n  * your email address or Government Gateway ID and password\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll also need information about the employee including their:\n\n  * National Insurance number\n  * average weekly earnings\n  * parental bereavement leave and pay arrangements - you can get this information from their self declaration\n\n\n\n[ Apply now ](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/submissions/new-form/apply-for-advance-payment-statutory-parental-bereavement-pay)\n\n### After you\u2019ve applied\n\nIf the advance is being paid to a third party and you\u2019re sending a completed R38 form by post, send it to HMRC within 4 weeks of applying for an advance.\n\nCorporate Treasury   \nHMRC   \nBX9 1BG   \n\n\nOnce your application has been approved, the money will be paid to the bank or building society account you provided or you\u2019ll be sent a cheque (payable order), depending on which payment option you chose.\n\nIf there are any issues with your application, HMRC will contact you directly.\n\n### Paying back your advance payment\n\nYou\u2019ll need to [pay back your advance payment](/recover-statutory-payments/if-you-cant-afford-to-make-payments) through Employer Payment Summary (EPS).\n  *[HMRC]: HM Revenue and Customs",

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so here's the deal with Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay, right? If you're, like, an employee and you or your partner lost a child under 18 or had a stillbirth after 24 weeks of pregnancy, you might be able to get some time off and pay. This applies if the sad event happened on or after a couple of dates, like April 6, 2020, for England, Scotland, and Wales, and for Northern Ireland it\u2019s April 6, 2022. And I guess there's also a Welsh version of this guide, if that's your thing.\n\nSo, about the leave \u2013 you can get 2 weeks off, no matter how long you\u2019ve been at your job. You can take those 2 weeks all at once, or split them into two separate weeks, or just take one week if that's all you need. The leave starts on or after the date the child dies or was stillborn, and you have to take it within 56 weeks of that sad date.\n\nAlso, if you were already on leave for some other reason when this happens, you gotta wait until that\u2019s done before you can take the bereavement leave. Makes sense, right? But if you start another leave during your bereavement leave, you can just continue your bereavement leave once that's over. This whole thing can be tricky, but just know there are rules around not doubling up with other leave.\n\nNow, about the money part. If you qualify, you get either about \u00a3184.03 a week or 90% of your average weekly earnings, whichever is lower. But yeah, deductions for tax and National Insurance will happen. To figure out how much you get, you can use some Basic PAYE tools they have around, or even do the math manually if that's your jam.\n\nNow, if you've got a sweet company policy that offers more than the bare minimum of leave or pay, that\u2019s cool too, but just make sure everyone knows about it. You can usually only get back about 92% of any payments you\u2019ve made from the government, but there\u2019s a chance for 103% if you're a small employer - whatever that means!\n\nAlso, during this leave, your job protection rights are on. So, like, your pay raises, vacation days, and getting back to your old job are all still in play, even if you stop trading. \n\nTo be eligible for all this stuff, you need to meet some criteria as a parent or caregiver. If you had the child living with you for like 4 weeks before they passed away and had like day-to-day responsibility, you might get something too. There are more specifics about who qualifies, especially if you're an adoptive parent or if a surrogate was involved.\n\nSo, just to recap, an employee needs to be counted as an employee (makes sense, doesn't it?) and they need to give notice correctly. And, of course, there's a whole notice period that\u2019s split into two parts after the child\u2019s death, which can get a bit overwhelming, but they've got timelines on that.\n\nLike, don\u2019t worry if they inform you just by texting or calling. No formalities, supposedly. They can cancel the leave too if they give notice before the deadline, but yeah, that also has deadlines. If they need to claim the bereavement pay, they gotta do it within 28 days after the sad week starts.\n\nWhen it comes to keeping records for the government, you'll need to save a bunch of stuff for potential audits, like when they started claiming. And if someone is unhappy with the government\u2019s decision about payments, they can reach out to some disputes team for help. \n\nOh! And if you can't pay for an employee\u2019s statutory pay, you can ask for an advance online, but make sure you have everything ready and can provide some employee details. \n\nSo, yeah, it\u2019s a whole lengthy process to understand, but just take it one step at a time. Good luck with all that!",

Seriously, if you fire them just because they went to court, they could totally take you to court yourself. Kinda ironic, huh?\n\nNow, you can ask them to try to push their jury duty back if it's gonna mess up your business really bad. But they'll need a letter from you explaining your situation. And just a heads up, they can only do that once a year and have to tell the court when they can actually serve.\n\nJury duty usually lasts, like, up to 10 days, but it could drag on longer sometimes. Just a little thing to keep in mind!\n\nNow, about paying them. You don't HAVE to pay them while they're doing the jury thing, but a lot of companies do it anyway. If you decide to keep paying your employee, just remember to do the usual tax and stuff like National Insurance, you know? You can\u2019t get back any money you gave them while they were off serving, that\u2019s just how it is.\n\nBut! If you don\u2019t pay them, they can actually ask the court for some money for their lost earnings, which is kinda cool for them. You'll need to fill out this certificate for their lost earnings, and they should get one of those with their jury summons.\n\nIf their jury service goes over three months, be sure to mark 'Yes' in the irregular payment field on your payment forms or whatever. Not that anyone knows what that means, but it\u2019s important!\n\nAnd if you're feeling generous and wanna give them some extra money to cover what they lost, that's fine too. Just fill out that same loss of earnings thing and do some math to figure out how much to give them. Basically, you subtract what the court pays them from their normal paycheck. Easy peasy. Don\u2019t forget to do all the payroll stuff like taxes and National Insurance because, y'know, that\u2019s super important.\n\nWhen they come back to work, if they were on this weird tax thing called a cumulative tax code, they might have some extra tax stuff to deal with. Your payroll software should have it all worked out for you on their next payday, like if they owe less or need a refund or whatever.\n\nOh, and if you\u2019re freaking out about how to pay this or if it's gonna hurt your wallet too much, there\u2019s some place to apply for help with that.

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so like, if you're an employer, you've got stuff to handle with your workers and it's all about the kinds of contracts you give them and what their job status is, you know? There\u2019s like, a bunch of contracts like full-time, part-time, fixed-term, agency staff, freelancers, and those odd zero-hours contracts. Oh, and don\u2019t forget about the special rules for family, young folks, and volunteers! \n\nSo, with full-time and part-time jobs, you gotta do some key things. First, like, you totally need to provide a written employment statement or a contract or whatever. And there\u2019s this thing about giving the minimum holidays, which is basically paid time off, along with pay slips that show all kinds of deductions, like the National Insurance stuff \u2014 that\u2019s a must. And employees need rest breaks, and if they get sick, they should get sick pay, maternity stuff, paternity pay, and leaves (like the fun parental stuff).\n\nPlus, hey, remember to not let your workers overdo it with hours, you need to pay at least minimum wage, you should have some insurance to cover yourself, make sure the workplace is safe (biggie!), register for taxes, and also listen to requests for flexible hours. Oh, and don't ignore discrimination stuff or you\u2019ll be in trouble. Oh, also, if someone has a disability, you gotta make some reasonable changes to your workplace too. Super important.\n\nNow, fixed-term contracts are basically jobs for a set time and they end when a job gets done or an event happens, kinda clear-cut. These guys gotta get treated the same as full-timers. You can read more on their rights if that's your jam.\n\nThen you got agency staff, which is like hiring through agencies for temp jobs. So, you pay the agency instead of the workers directly \u2014 which includes their NICs and sick pay. This means the agency has to make sure they follow the rules about how long folks can work. Also, after like 12 weeks, they should get the same deal as full-timers. You gotta tell the agency about your terms so the workers know what\u2019s up too. And they can use your facilities like lunchrooms and stuff from day one. But yeah, safety is still your job somehow.\n\nFreelancers and consultants? Well, they\u2019re sort of self-employed, often handling their own taxes and whatnot. They might miss some rights like getting minimum pay, but again, you\u2019ve gotta keep them safe and sound.\n\nAnd zero-hours contracts \u2014 those are laid-back agreements. Workers are just kinda on deck when you need them but you don\u2019t have to give them work at all. They don\u2019t have to show up either, so it\u2019s a give-and-take, I guess? They still get things like statutory leave and minimum wage, just like everyone else, and they can\u2019t be stopped from taking other jobs \u2014 unless you\u2019re being shady, which you shouldn\u2019t be. Still responsible for health and safety on that front too, together with all your staff.\n\nAbout family hiring? You can\u2019t play favorites with family members like in pay or promotion. You\u2019ve gotta handle tax and NIC payments like normal and follow rules for young family members, especially. Also, check if you gotta provide them a pension plan too.\n\nWhen it comes to volunteers, you gotta look out for them as well, giving them some training and info on how to stay safe. \n\nOh, and young people? You can hire them if they\u2019re 13 or older but they\u2019ve got some rules on how long they can work and what jobs are in the cards. They\u2019re an adult worker when they hit 18, then it\u2019s different rules. You need to assess risks before bringing in young workers, and even they get some rights \u2014 like maternity and redundancy pay if they\u2019ve worked long enough. They may also be paid different scales under the NMW than regular adult workers.\n\nSo yeah, just make sure you cover all these points and you should be good to go with your staffing.",

Employers must work out each worker\u2019s status in both employment law and tax law.\n\nIf someone is classed as an employee for tax purposes, their employer must tell HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) when the person [starts being an employee](/new-employee) or [stops being an employee](/employee-leaving).\n\n## Employment rights\n\nAll employees are workers, but an employee has extra employment rights and responsibilities that do not apply to workers who are not employees.\n\nThese rights include all of the rights [workers](/employment-status/worker) have and:\n\n  * [Statutory Sick Pay](/statutory-sick-pay-ssp)\n  * [statutory maternity pay and leave](/maternity-pay-leave) (workers only get pay, not leave)\n  * [statutory paternity pay and leave](/paternity-pay-leave) (workers only get pay, not leave)\n  * [statutory adoption pay and leave](/adoption-pay-leave) (workers only get pay, not leave)\n  * [statutory shared parental pay and leave](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay) (workers only get pay, not leave)\n  * minimum notice periods if their employment will be ending, for example if an employer is dismissing them\n  * protection against [unfair dismissal](/dismissal/unfair-and-constructive-dismissal)\n  * the right to request [flexible working](/flexible-working)\n  * [time off for emergencies](/time-off-for-dependants)\n  * [Statutory Redundancy Pay](/redundant-your-rights/redundancy-pay)\n\n\n\nSome of these rights require a minimum length of [continuous employment](/continuous-employment-what-it-is) before an employee qualifies for them. An employment contract may state how long this qualification period is.\n\n## Working out employment status for an employee\n\nSomeone who works for a business is probably an employee if most of the following are true:\n\n  * they\u2019re required to work regularly unless they\u2019re on leave, for example [they\u2019re on holiday](/holiday-entitlement-rights) or [on sick leave](/taking-sick-leave) or [on maternity leave](/maternity-leave)\n  * they\u2019re required to do a minimum number of hours and expect to be paid for time worked\n  * a manager or supervisor is responsible for their workload, saying when a piece of work should be finished and how it should be done\n  * they cannot send someone else to do their work\n  * they get paid holiday\n  * they\u2019re entitled to contractual or [Statutory Sick Pay](/statutory-sick-pay-ssp) and to [maternity pay](/statutory-maternity-pay) or to [paternity pay](/paternity-pay)\n  * they can join the business\u2019s pension scheme\n  * the business\u2019s disciplinary and grievance procedures apply to them\n  * they work at the business\u2019s premises or at an address specified by the business\n  * their contract sets out redundancy procedures\n  * the business provides the materials, tools and equipment for their work\n  * they only work for the business or if they do have another job, it\u2019s completely different from their work for the business\n  * their contract, statement of terms and conditions or offer letter (which can be described as an [\u2018employment contract\u2019](/employment-contracts-and-conditions/overview)) uses terms like \u2018employer\u2019 and \u2018employee\u2019\n\n\n\nIf most of these do not apply, you should work out if the person is [self-employed](/employment-status/selfemployed-contractor).\n\nIndividuals and their employers may have to pay unpaid tax and penalties, or lose entitlement to benefits, if their employment status is wrong.\n\n### Check employment status for tax purposes\n\nFor tax purposes, you can [check someone\u2019s employment status online](/guidance/check-employment-status-for-tax) to see if a worker should be classed as employed or self-employed.\n\n## Employee shareholders \n\nAn employee shareholder is someone who works under an [employment contract](/employment-contracts-and-conditions/overview) and owns at least \u00a32,000 worth of shares in the employer\u2019s company or parent company.\n\n## Employment rights\n\nEmployee shareholders have most of the same employment rights as [people who are workers](/employment-status/worker) and as [people who are employees](/employment-status/employee).\n\nThey also have the right to collective redundancy consultation and [transfer of undertakings (TUPE)](http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1655) \\- this protects the employee\u2019s terms and conditions when the business is transferred to a new owner.\n\nEmployee shareholders do not have these rights:\n\n  * protection against [unfair dismissal](/dismissal/unfair-and-constructive-dismissal) \\- apart from dismissal on grounds of discrimination and in relation to health and safety\n  * [statutory redundancy pay](/redundant-your-rights/redundancy-pay)\n  * the right to request [flexible working](/flexible-working) \\- except in the 2 weeks after returning from parental leave\n  * certain statutory rights to request time off for training\n\n\n\nEmployee shareholders must give 16 weeks\u2019 notice if they want to come back early from:\n\n  * [maternity leave](/maternity-pay-leave/overview)\n  * [additional paternity leave](/paternity-pay-leave/leave)\n  * [adoption leave](/adoption-pay-leave/leave)\n\n\n\nEmployers can choose more generous employment rights than the statutory ones.\n\n## Tax relief and obligations\n\nEmployee shareholders can get [tax relief](/tax-employee-share-schemes/employee-shareholder-shares) on the first \u00a32,000 of shares they get before 1 December 2016.\n\nEmployee shareholders must pay [tax on buying and selling shares](/tax-buying-selling-shares/selling-shares).\n\nHM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has further guidance on [tax relief for employee shareholders](/guidance/employee-shareholders).\n\n## Applying for employment shareholder jobs\n\nAnyone can apply for an employee shareholder job.\n\nPeople claiming Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance do not have to apply for an employee shareholder job that Jobcentre Plus have told them about.\n\nExisting employees do not have to accept a change to an employment contract to become an employee shareholder if they do not want to.\n\n## Offering employment shareholder status\n\nEmployers must following certain [rules when offering employment shareholder status](/employee-shareholders) to their employees.\n\n## Self-employed and contractor \n\nA person is self-employed if they run their business for themselves and take responsibility for its success or failure.\n\nSelf-employed workers are not paid through PAYE, and they do not have the [rights and responsibilities of an employee](/employment-status/employee).\n\nIf someone:\n\n  * becomes self-employed, they must [check if they need to set up a business](/set-up-business)\n  * stops being self-employed, they should [tell HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)](/stop-being-self-employed)\n\n\n\nSomeone can be both employed and self-employed at the same time, for example if they work for an employer during the day and run their own business in the evenings.\n\n## Employment rights\n\nEmployment law does not cover self-employed people in most cases because they are their own boss.\n\nIf a person is self-employed, they have:\n\n  * protection of their health and safety\n  * protection of their [rights against discrimination](/discrimination-your-rights) (in some cases)\n  * the rights and responsibilities set out by the terms of the contract they have with their client\n\n\n\n## Working out if someone is self-employed\n\nHMRC may regard someone as self-employed for tax purposes even if they have a different status in employment law.\n\nEmployers should check if a worker is self-employed in:\n\n  * tax law - in case the worker is exempt from the employer\u2019s PAYE scheme\n  * employment law - in case the worker has employee or worker rights\n\n\n\nIndividuals and their employers may have to pay unpaid tax and penalties, or lose entitlement to benefits, if their employment status is wrong.\n\n### Checking if they\u2019re self-employed for tax purposes\n\nFor tax purposes, you can [check someone\u2019s employment status online](/guidance/check-employment-status-for-tax) to see if a worker should be classed as employed or self-employed.\n\nThere are [special rules for businesses supplying workers](/guidance/employment-status-employment-intermediaries), for example an employment agency.\n\n### Checking their employment rights\n\nIf someone is self-employed, they do not have the [rights and responsibilities of an employee](/employment-status/employee) or the [rights and responsibilities of a worker](/employment-status/worker).\n\nSomeone is probably self-employed if they\u2019re self-employed for tax purposes and most of the following are true:\n\n  * they put in bids or give quotes to get work\n  * they\u2019re not under direct supervision when working\n  * they submit invoices for the work they\u2019ve done\n  * they\u2019re responsible for paying their own National Insurance and tax\n  * they do not get holiday or sick pay when they\u2019re not working\n  * they operate under a contract (sometimes known as a \u2018contract for services\u2019 or \u2018consultancy agreement\u2019) that uses terms like \u2018self-employed\u2019, \u2018consultant\u2019 or an \u2018independent contractor\u2019\n\n\n\n## Contractors\n\nA contractor can:\n\n  * be self-employed\n  * have the [employment status of a worker](/employment-status/worker)\n  * have the [employment status of an employee](/employment-status/employee) if they work for a client and are employed by an agency\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a special scheme for self-employed contractors and sub-contractors working in the construction industry called the [Construction Industry Scheme](/what-is-the-construction-industry-scheme) (CIS).\n\nContractor rules changed on 6 April 2021. Your employment status and the way you pay tax may have changed. Check the [off-payroll working rules for IR35](/guidance/understanding-off-payroll-working-ir35).\n\n## Director \n\nCompany directors run [limited companies](/running-a-limited-company) on behalf of shareholders.\n\nDirectors have different rights and responsibilities from employees, and are classed as [office holders](/employment-status/office-holder) for tax and [National Insurance contribution](/national-insurance-rates-letters/contribution-rates) purposes.\n\nIf a person does other work that\u2019s not related to being a director, they may have an employment contract and get employment rights.\n\n## Office holder \n\nA person who\u2019s been appointed to a position by a company or organisation but does not have a contract or receive regular payment may be an office holder. This includes:\n\n  * statutory appointments, such as registered company directors or secretaries, board members of statutory bodies, or crown appointments\n  * appointments under the internal constitution of an organisation, such as club treasurers or trade union secretaries\n  * appointments under a trust deed, such as trustees\n  * ecclesiastical appointment, such as members of the clergy\n\n\n\nOffice holders are neither employees nor workers. However, it\u2019s possible for someone to be an office holder and an employee if they have an employment contract with the same company or organisation that meets [the criteria for employees](/employment-status/employee).\n\n## Working out employment status for an office holder\n\nSomeone is likely to be an office holder if most of these statements apply to them:\n\n  * there is no contract or service agreement relating to their appointment\n  * their duties are minimal, and are only those required under the relevant statute, constitution or trust deed\n  * they do not get a salary or any other form of regular payment for their services\n  * the only payment they get is a voluntary payment (honorarium), regardless of the work they do - tax and National Insurance are deducted by the appointing body\n  * they\u2019re effectively working as an independent office, and are not under the close supervision or control of the appointing body\n\n## Legal decisions on employment status \n\nA court or [employment tribunal](/employment-tribunals/taking-a-case-to-an-employment-tribunal) (known as an [industrial tribunal](http://www.employmenttribunalsni.co.uk/) in Northern Ireland) can make a final decision on employment status for employment rights purposes. They\u2019ll look at how the employment relationship between the person and the business works in practice.\n\nHM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) may separately argue that someone is self-employed for tax purposes. This may be confirmed by the tax tribunal and the courts.\n\nAn employment tribunal or court may still make a decision that someone is a worker or employee for employment rights purposes.\n  *[Acas]: Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service\n  *[HMRC]: HM Revenue and Customs\n  *[CIS]: Construction Industry Scheme",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, like, employment law is about how people get treated at work and stuff, like their rights and what their boss is supposed to do. It's kinda important to know that someone's employment status can be different when it comes to taxes, which is kinda annoying. So there\u2019s like a few main job statuses, which are:\n\n- worker\n- employee\n- self-employed and contractor\n- director \n- office holder \n\nIf you wanna figure out all this work stuff, you can hit up Acas or the Labour Relations Agency if you're in Northern Ireland. They\u2019re a nice bunch that can help you out with your questions about rights and responsibilities. You can call Acas at 0300 123 1100, and they\u2019re around Monday to Friday, from 8 to 6 or something like that. Oh, and don't forget to check out call charges if you care about that.\n\nRight, so let\u2019s chat about workers first. Basically, you\u2019re a worker if you have a contract or, like, some deal to do work for a reward (which is just money or something cool). You can\u2019t just send someone else to do your job a lot, and your employer needs to have work for you while your deal is good or whatever. If you\u2019re working through your own limited company and the boss is really just a client or something, then that doesn\u2019t count. \n\nNow about worker rights - pretty sweet stuff like:\n- getting minimum wage, duh\n- they can\u2019t just take money from your pay without a good reason\n- you get some holiday time, but it\u2019s the minimum kinda stuff\n- you have a right to breaks\n- you shouldn\u2019t be working more than 48 hours a week, unless you want to\n- no discrimination vibes\n- whistleblower protection, like if you wanna report bad stuff at work\n- oh, and part-time workers can\u2019t be treated any worse \n\nSometimes they can also get:\n- sick pay (if they\u2019re lucky)\n- maternity/paternity leave pay (which is cool)\n\nBut they also usually don\u2019t get certain stuff like notice periods when they lose their job, or protection against being unfairly fired, which kinda stinks.  \n\nAlright, moving on to casual work which is kinda random. If you work occasionally, and it\u2019s on your terms a lot, then you\u2019re probably a worker. If you\u2019re doing stuff on casual or freelance contracts, if your boss kinda supervises you, and if they tax your pay, then yep, you\u2019re probably a worker. \n\nNow, employees - that\u2019s like an upgrade from being a worker. You gotta work under an actual employment contract, and it can get a bit complicated with tax stuff too. Employers gotta figure out what status everyone has so they don\u2019t mess up.\n\nSo employees get more rights than just workers, like:\n- all the worker rights, but with a bit more\n- proper sick pay and maternity/paternity leave with some extra protections\n- minimum notice if they\u2019re gonna be let go\n- they can ask for time off for emergencies and stuff\n- redundancy pay if they\u2019re let go (which is kinda nice)\n\nYou wanna be an employee if possible, cause it\u2019s a better status, you know? \n\nThen we\u2019ve got self-employed people and contractors. They\u2019re running their own show, and don\u2019t have those employee rights. They make their own business decisions and it\u2019s kinda the wild west for them, right? They bill people for jobs, work without supervision, and pay their own taxes and National Insurance. \n\nDirectors run companies and have to deal with different rules than employees do, which is super complex. And office holders are like people who get appointed but don\u2019t have contracts \u2013 think of like a club president or something, getting paid, but not really much. \n\nUh, and courts can figure out if someone\u2019s a worker or an employee if there\u2019s a dispute, and there might be tax implications too. So double-check the status, cause nobody wants to mess up their taxes.  \n\nLastly, if someone wants a fancy role as an employee shareholder - that\u2019s just an employee with shares in the company. They have rights like workers, but some stuff is different, like if they get kicked out, it\u2019s kinda tricky. \n\nThe whole employment status thing feels like learning a new language. You can check out online tools to see where you stand. Just make sure to know what\u2019s what so you don\u2019t get caught up in a messy tax thing or anything.",

      "body": "## Entitlement \n\nAlmost all people [classed as workers](/employment-status/worker) are legally entitled to 5.6 weeks\u2019 paid holiday a year (known as statutory leave entitlement or annual leave).\n\nThis includes:\n\n  * agency workers\n  * workers with \u2018irregular hours\u2019 (where the number of hours they work in a pay period often or always changes)\n  * \u2018part-year\u2019 workers (where there are periods of at least a week in a leave year where they do not need to work and are not paid)\n\n\n\nAn employer can include bank holidays as part of statutory annual leave.\n\n## Statutory annual leave entitlement\n\nMost workers who work a 5-day week must receive at least 28 days\u2019 paid annual leave a year. This is the equivalent of 5.6 weeks of holiday. \n\n### Working part-time\n\nPart-time workers who work regular hours for the whole year are entitled to at least 5.6 weeks\u2019 paid holiday, but this will amount to fewer than 28 days. \n\nFor example, if they work 3 days a week, they must get at least 16.8 days\u2019 leave a year (3 \u00d7 5.6).\n\nUse the [holiday entitlement calculator](/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement) to work out a part-time worker\u2019s leave.\n\n### Working irregular hours or for part of the year\n\nPeople working irregular hours or part of the year are entitled to up to 5.6 weeks statutory leave.\n\nThey will build up (\u2018accrue\u2019) leave depending on the hours they\u2019ve already worked, rather than getting a fixed number of days or hours.\n\nUse the [holiday entitlement calculator](/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement) to work out how much leave they\u2019ve accrued in a pay period.\n\nFor leave years beginning on or before 31 March 2024, leave entitlement for irregular-hours and part-year workers does not need to be accrued based on hours they\u2019ve already worked. You can use the [holiday entitlement calculator](/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement) to estimate their entitlement based on the average days or hours they work each week.\n\n### Limits on statutory leave\n\nStatutory paid holiday entitlement is limited to 28 days. For example, staff working 6 days a week are only entitled to 28 days\u2019 paid holiday.\n\n### Bank holidays\n\nBank or public holidays do not have to be given as paid leave.\n\nAn employer can choose to include bank holidays as part of a worker\u2019s statutory annual leave.\n\n## Extra leave\n\nAn employer can choose to offer more leave than the legal minimum. They do not have to apply all the rules that apply to statutory leave to the extra leave. For example, a worker might need to be employed for a certain amount of time before they become entitled to it.\n\n## Other aspects of holiday entitlement\n\nWorkers have the right to:\n\n  * [get holiday pay](/holiday-entitlement-rights/holiday-pay-the-basics)\n  * build up holiday entitlement during certain types of leave, such as maternity, paternity, or adoption leave\n  * build up holiday entitlement while off work sick\n  * request holiday at the same time as [sick leave](/taking-sick-leave)\n\n\n\n## Disputes\n\nPaid annual leave is a legal right that an employer must provide. If a worker thinks their rights to leave and pay are not being met there are a number of ways to [resolve the dispute](/solve-workplace-dispute).\n\n## Calculate leave entitlement \n\nFor regular-hours workers, employers can use a \u2018leave year\u2019 or an \u2018accrual\u2019 system to work out how much leave their staff should get.\n\nFor irregular-hours and part-year workers, employers must use a specific accrual system.\n\nFor leave years beginning on or before 31 March 2024, employers can use either a leave year or an accrual system to work out leave for irregular-hours or part-year workers. You can use the [holiday entitlement calculator](/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement) to estimate their entitlement based on the average days or hours they work each week.\n\n## Leave year\n\nAn employer should tell their staff the dates of their statutory leave year as soon as they start working, for example, it might run from 1 January to 31 December.\n\nWorkers must take their statutory leave during this time. If a leave year is not set out in a contract then it will start:\n\n  * on the first day of a new job (if started after 1 October 1998)\n  * on 1 October (if started on or before 1 October 1998)\n\n\n\nThe leave year and holiday entitlement is not affected by maternity, paternity or adoption leave. The employee still builds up (\u2018accrues\u2019) holiday over these periods.\n\n### Leave entitlement when starting a new job\n\nIf a worker starts their job part-way through a leave year, they\u2019re only entitled to part of their total annual leave for the current leave year. What they get depends on how much of the year is left.\n\nUse the [holiday entitlement calculator](/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement) to work out how much leave someone has left.\n\n## Accrual system\n\nFor regular hours workers, annual leave begins to build up (\u2018accrue\u2019) as soon as they start their job. An employer can use an accrual system to work out a worker\u2019s leave during the first year of the job. Under this system, a worker gets one-twelfth of their leave in each month.\n\nExample\n\nSomeone works a 5-day week and is entitled to 28 days\u2019 annual leave a year. After their third month in the job, they\u2019d be entitled to 7 days\u2019 leave (a quarter of their total leave, or 28 \u00f7 12 \u00d7 3).\n\n### Irregular-hours or part-year workers\n\nEmployers need to use a specific accrual system to calculate leave for irregular-hours or part-year workers.\n\nIf their leave year began on or before 31 March 2024, employers do not need to use this system until their leave year renews.\n\nThe amount of leave depends on:\n\n  * how often they get paid (their \u2018pay period\u2019) \n\n  * how many hours they worked in a pay period\n\n\n\n\nTheir entitlement will be 12.07% of the hours they worked in a pay period. It must be rounded up to the nearest hour if the entitlement is 0.5 of an hour or more.\n\nFor example, if they worked 30 hours and are paid weekly, they\u2019ll have earned 4 hours leave (30 \u00d7 12.07 \u00f7 100 = 3.621). They can take this leave from their next pay period.\n\n## Carrying over leave\n\nThe worker\u2019s contract says how many days\u2019 leave they can carry over into the next year.\n\nIf a worker gets 28 days\u2019 leave, they can carry over a maximum of 8 days.\n\nIf a worker gets more than 28 days\u2019 leave, their employer may allow them to carry over any additional untaken leave. Check the employment contract, company handbook or intranet to see what the rules say.\n\n### Workers on parental or sick leave\n\nIf a worker cannot take some or all of their leave entitlement because they\u2019re on family-related leave, for example parental leave, they can carry over their untaken leave into next year.\n\nIf a worker could not take their leave entitlement because they were sick, they can carry over:\n\n  * up to 20 of their 28 days\u2019 leave entitlement if they work regular hours for the whole year\n  * up to 28 days of their leave entitlement if they work irregular hours or for part of the year\n\n\n\n### If a worker was unable to take leave\n\nWorkers can carry over their whole leave entitlement if any of the following apply:\n\n  * they did not receive [\u2018rolled-up holiday pay\u2019](/holiday-entitlement-rights/holiday-pay-the-basics) that they were entitled to\n  * they were not given reasonable opportunity to take leave\n  * they were not told that they would lose their leave if they did not take it by the end of the leave year\n\n## Holiday pay \n\nWorkers are entitled to a week\u2019s pay for each week of statutory leave that they take.\n\nMost workers are entitled to 5.6 weeks\u2019 paid holiday a year. You can use the [holiday calculator](/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement) to work out how much leave someone should get.\n\n## How to work out a week\u2019s pay\n\nA week\u2019s pay is worked out according to the kind of hours someone works and how they\u2019re paid for the hours. This includes full-time, part-time, term-time and casual workers.\n\nWorking pattern | How a week\u2019s pay is calculated  \n---|---  \nRegular hours and fixed pay (full- or part-time) | A worker\u2019s pay for a week  \nShift work with regular hours (full- or part-time) | The average number of weekly fixed hours a worker has worked in the previous 52 weeks, at their average hourly rate  \nIrregular-hours and part-year work | A worker\u2019s average pay from the previous 52 weeks (only counting weeks in which they were paid)  \n  \n## Calculating average hourly or weekly rate\n\nTo calculate average hourly rate, only the hours worked and how much was paid for them should be counted. Take the average rate over the last 52 weeks.\n\nA \u2018week\u2019 usually runs from Sunday to Saturday. Only use another 7-day period (like Thursday to Wednesday) if that\u2019s how a worker\u2019s pay is calculated.\n\nIf no pay was paid in any week, count back another week so the rate is based on 52 weeks in which pay was paid. You can count back a maximum of 104 weeks to find these. \n\nIf a worker has less than 52 weeks of pay, use the average pay rate for the full weeks they have worked.\n\n## Workers who are paid monthly\n\nTo work out a week\u2019s pay for someone who\u2019s paid monthly:\n\n  1. Calculate the worker\u2019s average hourly pay for the last month. Do this by dividing the month\u2019s pay by the number of hours worked in the month.\n\n  2. Calculate the weekly pay. Do this by multiplying the average hourly pay by the number of hours worked in a week.\n\n\n\n\nUse the weekly pay calculation for each of the last 52 weeks to work out an average week\u2019s pay.\n\n## \u2018Basic\u2019 and \u2018normal\u2019 rate of pay\n\nFor regular-hours workers (full- or part-time), employers must pay:\n\n  * at least 4 weeks of the worker\u2019s statutory entitlement at their \u2018normal\u2019 rate of pay\n  * the remaining 1.6 weeks at a \u2018basic\u2019 rate of pay\n\n\n\nFor workers who work part of the year, employers must also follow these rules if the worker\u2019s leave year began on or before 31 March 2024.\n\nFor irregular-hours workers or those who work part of the year, all leave must be paid at their \u2018normal\u2019 rate of pay.\n\n\u2018Normal\u2019 rate of pay includes commission, regular overtime payments, and any payments related to length of service or professional qualifications. It does not usually include bonus payments.\n\n## Rolled-up holiday pay\n\nFor regular-hours workers (full- or part- time), an employer cannot include an amount for holiday pay in the hourly rate (known as \u2018rolled-up holiday pay\u2019).\n\nEmployers can use rolled-up holiday pay for irregular-hours and part-year workers, unless their leave year began on or before 31 March 2024.\n\n## More information\n\nThere\u2019s [guidance for calculating holiday pay for workers without fixed hours or pay](/government/publications/calculating-holiday-pay-for-workers-without-fixed-hours-or-pay), which includes several examples.\n\nYou can also contact the [Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas)](https://www.acas.org.uk/contact) with questions about general holiday pay issues.\n\nAcas helpline   \nTelephone: 0300 123 11 00  \nTextphone: 18001 0300 123 1100  \nMonday to Friday, 8am to 6pm   \n[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)\n\n## Booking time off \n\nThe general notice period for taking leave is at least twice as long as the amount of leave a worker wants to take, plus 1 day. For example, a worker would give 3 days\u2019 notice for 1 day\u2019s leave.\n\nAn employer can refuse a leave request or cancel leave but they must give as much notice as the amount of leave requested, plus 1 day. For example, an employer would give 11 days\u2019 notice if the worker asked for 10 days\u2019 leave.\n\nIf the contract says something different about the notice a worker or employer should give, what\u2019s in the contract will apply.\n\nAlthough employers can refuse to give leave at a certain time, they cannot refuse to let workers take the leave at all.\n\n## Part leave days\n\nSome workers may be entitled to a part leave day - for example if they\u2019re part-time or have a half day\u2019s leave to take. How a part day should be taken is up to the employer.\n\n## When leave can and cannot be taken\n\nEmployers can:\n\n  * tell their staff to take leave, for example bank holidays or Christmas\n  * restrict when leave can be taken, for example at certain busy periods\n\n\n\nThere may be rules about this in the employment contract.\n\nThe notice period for this is at least twice as long as the leave they want their staff to take. The employer must tell the worker before the notice period begins.\n\nIf an employer wants a worker to take leave, they need to make sure that the worker can relax, rest and enjoy leisure during their holiday. For example, an employer cannot force a sick worker to take leave.\n\n## Taking holiday before leaving a job \n\nDuring their notice period the worker may be able to take whatever is left of their statutory annual leave.\n\nUse the [holiday entitlement calculator](/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement) to work this out. How much they get depends on how much of the leave year has passed or how much leave they\u2019ve accrued.\n\n## Taking more leave than the entitlement\n\nIf a worker has taken more leave than they\u2019re entitled to, their employer must not take money from their final pay unless it\u2019s been agreed beforehand in writing. The rules in this situation should be outlined in the employment contract, company handbook or intranet.\n\n## Getting paid instead of taking holidays\n\nThe only time someone can get paid in place of taking statutory leave (known as \u2018payment in lieu\u2019) is when they leave their job. Employers must pay for untaken statutory leave, even if the worker is dismissed for gross misconduct.\n\nIf an employer offers more than 5.6 weeks\u2019 annual leave, they can agree separate arrangements for the extra leave.\n  *[Acas]: Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service",

      "poorly_written_article": "So like, uh, entitlement stuff. Basically, most workers (yeah, like almost all of \u2018em) are legally supposed to get like 5.6 weeks of paid holidays each year. They call this statutory leave or something, I guess? \n\nSo that includes people who work agencies, and those with, like, weird hours\u2014you know, not regular stuff. And even part-year workers who don\u2019t work all the time, like they might have weeks where they are totally off and not getting paid. \n\nAlso, employers can, I think, count bank holidays as part of the vacation time? Like, it\u2019s all kinda mixed together. \n\n### Statutory Holiday Basics  \nIf you work a 5-day week (who doesn\u2019t?), you gotta get at least 28 days paid time off. That\u2019s like 5.6 weeks of chill time.  \n\n#### Part-Time Work  \nNow, if you\u2019re part-time and have a regular schedule, yeah, you get at least those 5.6 weeks too\u2014but it\u2019s not gonna add up to 28 days unless you\u2019re working enough. So like, if you do, I dunno, 3 days a week? You would get 16.8 days off. It\u2019s like math, but not too hard.  \n\nYou can use the holiday calculator thingy to figure that out.  \n\n#### Irregular Workers  \nSo for folks who work crazy hours or only part of the year, they can get up to like, um, 5.6 weeks too. But it\u2019s based on the hours they actually clocked in, not a fixed number of days. They gotta keep track, so that calculator can help again.  \n\nAnd if the leave year starts before March 31, 2024, some rules say you don\u2019t always have to count the actual hours they've worked. Just look at their average work stuff.  \n\n### Limits on Leave  \nSo, like, you can\u2019t take more than 28 days off, that\u2019s just the rule. Even if you work six days a week, you\u2019re still capped at that.  \n\n### About Bank Holidays  \nBank holidays are kinda optional for paid leave, so an employer can just combine those with your statutory leave if they wanna.  \n\n### Extra Days Off  \nEmployers can totally give more vacation days than what\u2019s legally required, but they don\u2019t always have to do it the same way as the normal holiday rules. Like, you might need to work there longer to get those extra days or whatever.  \n\n### Workers' Rights  \nEveryone has some rights, like getting paid for holiday time, building up leaves while on maternity or sick leave, and asking for time off even when sick.  \n\n### Disputes  \nIf you feel like your time off and pay rights are being messed with, there are ways to handle that.  \n\n### Figuring Out Holiday Time  \nFor workers with regular hours, it\u2019s usually straightforward to calculate holiday, but if you\u2019ve got irregular hours, it can get trickier. They need some specific calculations, but keep using that calculator!  \n\n### Leave Year  \nEmployers should tell you when your leave year is, like when it starts and ends. If there\u2019s nothing in the contract, it just starts on your first day or maybe October 1st if you were hired before 1998.\n\nIf you start working part-way through, you only get a fraction of your vacation for that year. By the way, calculators are handy for figuring that out too!  \n\n### Accrual for Different Workers  \nAnnual leave starts building up as soon as you get hired. They can do this accrual way of counting it month by month. \n\nExample: If you work five days a week, after three months, you\u2019d have 7 days off. Pretty simple!  \n\n### Irregular Workers Again  \nBut for those working weird hours, they have their own calculations to do. It\u2019s kinda complicated, but not really if you pay attention.  \n\n### Carrying Over Days  \nYou can carry over some holiday days into the next year, but only if your contract says it's chill to do that. If you don\u2019t use them, you might lose some, or if you\u2019re sick or have family leave, you can save them up.  \n\n### Holiday Pay  \nWhen you actually take that time off, you get paid for it, obviously. It\u2019s usually a week\u2019s worth of pay for every week you\u2019re off.  \n\n### Workers Paid Monthly  \nFor monthly paid workers, it\u2019s kinda complicated too\u2014first, figure out the average from the last month then multiply it out to get weekly pay. It can be a bit of a hassle.  \n\n### Rolled-up Holiday Pay  \nEmployers can\u2019t just include holiday pay as part of your hourly rate, that's not how it works for full-time peeps. They can for irregular workers though until certain dates.  \n\n### Extra Info  \nCheck out more stuff online if you need more details, it gets kind of boring though, ya know? Or you can call Acas if you got questions\u2014pretty simple stuff!  \n\n### Booking Time Off  \nGenerally, you need to tell your boss you want to take time off like, at least twice as long before you actually want to go. Like for a one-day leave, you say it three days before.  \n\nThey can say no or change plans but gotta give notice too. If your contract says something different, listen to that.  \n\n### Final Notes  \nYou can\u2019t take more leave than you\u2019re allowed unless it was agreed. The only time you get paid for not taking holidays is when you leave the job. If you ever have any questions, look at the rules or ask someone who's got the info!",

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so here\u2019s the deal about having issues with your job. It's basically about two big things: grievances and disciplinaries. Grievances are like when you have problems or complaints, and you tell your boss about them. Disciplinaries are when your boss is not happy with your work, behavior, or maybe you\u2019ve been missing too many days or something.\n\nSo first up, you should chat with your manager to try to fix any problems casually if you can. Like, just tell them what\u2019s bugging you and maybe give some ideas on how to fix it. That's always a good starting point! A lot of times, they should talk to you about any disciplinary stuff casually first too because, you know, it might not even be that big of a deal.\n\nNow, you totally have the right to bring someone with you when you have those meetings about grievances or disciplinary stuff. Like, either a co-worker or someone from a union, or if it's cool, maybe a family member or a worker from Citizens Advice. You should check your employment paper or whatever to see what\u2019s allowed.\n\nIf things can\u2019t get sorted out casually, then it\u2019s time to go formal. So, grievances are like, when you talked to your boss and nothing changed. You can file a formal complaint if you\u2019re still not happy about it. Your employer has to write down their grievance process somewhere, probably in the handbook or HR stuff. It should have steps like writing a letter about your grievance, having a meeting to talk about it, and a way to appeal their decision if you\u2019re still not happy.\n\nOn the flip side, if your boss got issues with you, you might get hit with some disciplinary actions. They have to have rules written out too about what kind of stuff can get you in trouble, and all that jazz.\n\nOh, and if it\u2019s a serious issue, they might even suspend you until the meeting. You really should check if you\u2019ll still get paid if that happens, because, you know, money is important!\n\nThere's also this Acas Code of Practice thing that you should follow; if you don\u2019t, you could lose some money if it goes to court.\n\nSpeaking of which, you can appeal any decision they make whether it\u2019s about grievance or discipline. Just put it in writing and submit it. Your employer should say who to send it to and how long you got to do it and stuff.\n\nIf things are really messy, you can bring in a third party to help settle it, which could be mediation or conciliation or arbitration. \n\nMediation is when a neutral person talks to everyone to sort things out after trying to fix the issue informally. It\u2019s nice because you don\u2019t have to accept any of their ideas but is only good for stuff that isn't super serious like discrimination.\n\nConciliation is sorta like mediation but it's what you do before or after a formal claim in court. Acas offers help for that, too!\n\nThen there's arbitration, which is basically when a third-party decides for you if you both agree. If you don\u2019t, you can still take it to court. \n\nFinally, if nothing works out, you might end up in an employment tribunal. There, you and your boss will argue your sides, and then someone makes a decision.\n\nIf you need help, just call Acas or go to Citizen\u2019s Advice or maybe your trade union for some advice! Seriously, they\u2019re usually pretty helpful.\n\nAcas helpline is 0300 123 1100, just so you know when you need them! Hope that helps, kind of!",

      "body": "## Overview \n\nIt is against the law to treat someone less favourably than someone else because of a personal characteristic such as religion, sex, gender reassignment or age.\n\nDiscrimination can include:\n\n  * not hiring someone\n  * selecting a particular person for redundancy\n  * paying someone less than another worker without good reason\n\n\n\nYou can discriminate against someone even if you do not intend to. For example, you can discriminate indirectly by offering working conditions or rules that disadvantage one group of people more than another.\n\n## Discrimination in recruitment \n\n## Discrimination in job adverts\n\nYou must not state or imply in a job advert that you\u2019ll discriminate against anyone. This includes saying that you are not able to cater for workers with a disability.\n\nOnly use phrases like \u2018recent graduate\u2019 or \u2018highly experienced\u2019 when these are actual requirements of the job. Otherwise you could discriminate against younger or older people who might not have had the opportunity to get qualifications.\n\nWhere you advertise might cause indirect discrimination - for example, advertising only in men\u2019s magazines.\n\n### Get help advertising a job without discriminating\n\n**Employer Services Line**   \nTelephone: 0800 169 0178   \nTextphone: 0800 169 0172   \n[Video relay service](https://connect.interpreterslive.co.uk/vrs?ilc=DWP) for British Sign Language (BSL) users - [check you can use the service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oELNMfAvDxw)   \nMonday to Friday, 9am to 5pm   \n[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)\n\n## Questions you cannot ask when recruiting\n\nYou must not ask candidates about [\u2018protected characteristics\u2019](/discrimination-your-rights/types-of-discrimination) or whether they:\n\n  * are married, single or in a civil partnership\n  * have children or plan to have children\n\n\n\n### Asking about health or disability\n\nYou can only ask about health or [disability](/recruitment-disabled-people) if:\n\n  * there are necessary requirements of the job that cannot be met with [reasonable adjustments](/reasonable-adjustments-for-disabled-workers)\n  * you\u2019re finding out if someone needs help to take part in a selection test or interview\n  * you\u2019re using \u2018[positive action](/recruitment-disabled-people/encouraging-applications)\u2019 to recruit a disabled person\n\n\n\nYou might be breaking the law if any discrimination happens during their recruitment process, even if you use a recruitment agency.\n\n## Asking for a date of birth\n\nYou can only ask for someone\u2019s date of birth on an application form if they must be a certain age to do the job, for example selling alcohol.\n\nYou can ask someone their date of birth on a separate equality monitoring form. You should not let the person selecting or interviewing candidates see this form.\n\n## Spent criminal convictions\n\nApplicants do not have to tell you about [criminal convictions that are spent](/exoffenders-and-employment). You must treat the applicant as if the conviction has not happened, and cannot refuse to employ the person because of their conviction.\n\nThere are some areas of employment that are exempt from this rule, for example schools.\n\n## Trade union membership\n\nYou must not use membership of a trade union as a factor in deciding whether to employ someone. This includes:\n\n  * not employing someone because they\u2019re a member of a trade union\n  * insisting someone joins a trade union before you\u2019ll employ them\n\n\n\n## Employing people with protected characteristics\n\nYou can choose a candidate who has a [protected characteristic](/discrimination-your-rights/types-of-discrimination) over one who does not if they\u2019re both suitable for the job and you think that people with that characteristic:\n\n  * are underrepresented in the workforce, profession or industry\n  * suffer a disadvantage connected to that characteristic (for example people from a certain ethnic group are not often given jobs in your sector)\n\n\n\nYou can only do this if you\u2019re trying to address the under-representation or disadvantage for that particular characteristic. You must make decisions on a case by case basis and not because of a certain policy.\n\nYou cannot choose a candidate who is not as suitable for the job just because they have a protected characteristic.\n\n## Favouring disabled candidates\n\nWhen a disabled person and a non-disabled person both meet the job requirements, you can treat the disabled person more favourably.\n\n## Discrimination in work \n\nYou must not discriminate against your workers. This could be done by, for example:\n\n  * introducing policies or benefits that discriminate between workers, for example a benefit for married workers that\u2019s not available for people in a civil partnership\n  * paying men and women different amounts (this includes benefits, for example company cars) to do the same job\n  * choosing someone for redundancy because they have a protected characteristic\n  * failing to [make reasonable adjustments](/reasonable-adjustments-for-disabled-workers) for a disabled worker\n  * firing someone for making an allegation of discrimination\n  * firing someone because they\u2019re a union member\n  * unfairly rejecting a [request for flexible working](/flexible-working)\n\n\n\nThis includes self-employed people on a contract for you.\n\nYou cannot promote or train workers just because of their age or the time they\u2019ve worked for you.\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to ask workers about their future career plans, including retirement. These questions should only be asked in discussions about career development and not based on the employee\u2019s age.\n\n## Preventing discrimination\n\nYou can help prevent discrimination by:\n\n  * having an equality, diversity and inclusion policy\n  * providing regular anti-discrimination training\n  * making it clear what workers should do if discrimination happens\n\n\n\nFind out more about [how to prevent discrimination at work on the Acas website](https://www.acas.org.uk/discrimination-and-the-law/what-an-employer-can-do-to-prevent-discrimination).\n\nYou\u2019re responsible for any instances of discrimination at work unless you can show you\u2019ve done everything you reasonably could to prevent or stop it.\n\n## Employment tribunals\n\nA worker who thinks they\u2019ve been discriminated against can [raise a grievance](/solve-workplace-dispute/formal-procedures) or take their case to an employment tribunal.\n\n## Employing family members\n\nIf you hire members of your family you must:\n\n  * avoid special treatment in terms of pay, promotion and working conditions\n  * make sure tax and [National Insurance contributions](/national-insurance) are done correctly\n\n\n\n## Gender reassignment\n\nAs soon as a worker tells their employer that they\u2019re having gender reassignment, they\u2019re protected from discrimination. Discrimination includes:\n\n  * disadvantaging the worker because they have to take time off for medical treatment\n  * not allowing the worker to use facilities appropriate to their gender (for example, toilets)\n\n\n\nTo avoid discrimination, you must:\n\n  * change your records (for example, human resources records) when the worker has a Gender Reassignment Certificate and a new birth certificate\n  * make sure you keep any information the worker gives you about their gender history completely confidential",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, like, it\u2019s illegal to treat someone worse than someone else just because of stuff like their religion, gender, age, or whatever. Discrimination can be things like not hiring someone, firing someone just because, or, you know, paying them less than someone who's doing the same job without a good reason. \n\nAnd here\u2019s the thing \u2013 you can still discriminate without even trying to, like if the rules or working conditions make it harder for some group of people; that's indirect discrimination! Kinda tricky, huh?\n\nOkay, moving on to recruitment. \n\nWhen you\u2019re hiring, you can\u2019t put in the job ad anything that hints at not hiring someone, like saying you can\u2019t hire someone with a disability and all that. Words like \"recent grad\" or, like, \"super experienced\" should only be used if they\u2019re really needed for the job\u2014otherwise that could make it hard for older folks or younger guys who haven't got the chance to get those qualifications. Oh, and where you post your job ad can matter too; like only putting it in men\u2019s magazines could indirectly discriminate against women. \n\nNeed help with job ads? Sure! There\u2019s an Employer Services Line; just call 0800 169 0178 or use textphone\u2014yeah, that's a thing! It\u2019s open weekdays from 9 to 5 so don\u2019t forget that! \n\nAlso, when you\u2019re hiring, there's stuff you can\u2019t ask about, like a candidate's marriage status or if they have kids or plan to have any. That\u2019s a no-go! \n\nRegarding health or disability, you can only ask about that if it\u2019s super necessary for the job or if you need to know if they\u2019ll need help during interviews or tests. And hey, if you\u2019re trying to promote applications from disabled folks, that\u2019s okay too. \n\nYou can ask for date of birth only if they need to be a certain age for the job; like, selling booze or something. And you can ask for the date separately for monitoring or whatever, but don\u2019t let the person interviewing see that sheet.  \n\nAbout criminal records, if they\u2019ve got a spent conviction, they don\u2019t have to tell you, and you can\u2019t be like, \"no job for you\" just because of it\u2014unless it\u2019s a school or something. \n\nAlso, don\u2019t even think about deciding not to hire someone because they\u2019re in a union or making them join one to get a job. That\u2019s not cool.\n\nNow, if you\u2019ve got two job candidates and one has a protected characteristic and they both seem equally suitable, you can give the edge to the one with that characteristic if they're not well-represented in your industry or whatever. But make sure you\u2019re not picking someone who\u2019s less qualified just because of that.  \n\nOh, and if a disabled person and a non-disabled person both qualify for the job, you can give special treatment to the disabled candidate, which is pretty fair. \n\nYou can\u2019t discriminate against your employees either \u2013 like, don\u2019t offer perks just for married people and pay them different wages for doing the same job. And firing someone because they complained about discrimination? Not okay! \n\nTo keep discrimination from happening, it\u2019s good to have a diversity and equality policy and maybe some training for your staff. Also, make sure people know what to do if they see discrimination happening. It\u2019s your responsibility to show you\u2019ve tried to prevent it as best as you can!\n\nIf someone thinks they\u2019re discriminated against, they can totally raise a grievance or take it to an employment tribunal. \n\nWhen hiring family, just make sure they\u2019re not getting special treatment like better pay or promotions. You also have to do the tax right\u2014don't want trouble with the taxman, right? \n\nFor gender reassignment, once someone tells their boss they\u2019re transitioning, they\u2019re protected from discrimination. This means you can\u2019t disadvantage them if they need time off for treatment or make them use the wrong bathroom. Just keep everything about their gender change confidential, okay?  \n\nSo, yeah, just don\u2019t be a jerk when it comes to hiring and treating your employees\u2014simple as that!",

Other deductions you may need to make include student loan repayments or pension contributions.\n\n## Reporting to and paying HMRC\n\n### Reporting pay and deductions\n\nIf you run payroll yourself, you\u2019ll need to [report your employees\u2019 payments and deductions](/running-payroll/reporting-to-hmrc) to HMRC on or before each payday.\n\nYour payroll software will work out how much tax and National Insurance you owe, including an employer\u2019s National Insurance contribution on each employee\u2019s earnings above \u00a3175 a week.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to send another report to [claim any reduction](/running-payroll/reporting-to-hmrc-eps) on what you owe HMRC, for example for statutory pay.\n\n### Paying HMRC\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to view what you owe HMRC, based on your reports.

Your payroll provider will need these to run payroll for you.\n\nSome payroll providers can offer you more support if you need it, for example keeping employee records, providing payslips and making payments to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).\n\nAs an employer, you\u2019re legally responsible for completing all PAYE tasks - even if you pay someone else to do them.\n\n## Running payroll yourself\n\nYou need to complete [certain tasks to set up payroll](/paye-for-employers/setting-up-payroll) and pay your employees for the first time.

You must also do your best to recreate them - HMRC may be able to help if you\u2019re not sure how much you paid your employees.\n\nYou must tell HMRC if your [final payroll report](/payroll-annual-reporting/send-your-final-payroll-report) of the tax year includes figures that are:\n\n  * estimated - that you want HMRC to accept as final\n  * provisional - that you\u2019ll update later with actual figures\n\n\n\n## Data protection\n\nYou must follow rules on [data protection](/data-protection-your-business) if your business stores or uses personal information.\n  *[PAYE]: Pay As You Earn\n  *[HMRC]: HM Revenue and Customs",

      "poorly_written_article": "Hey there! So, like, if you\u2019re an employer, you\u2019re usually gotta do this thing called PAYE. It\u2019s basically the HMRC system\u2014those are the tax people\u2014to grab Income Tax and National Insurance from the folks you pay.\n\nNow, about registering for PAYE\u2014yeah, you gotta do it if any of these things hit your employees this current tax year (so like, since April 6th):\n- If they make \u00a3123 or more a week (so, don\u2019t pay them less, okay?)\n- If they get expenses or company perks (like a free lunch, maybe?)\n- If they\u2019re on a pension (old people need money too)\n- If they've ever had another job (multi-taskers, right?)\n- If they got benefits like Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance or Employment Support or whatever. \n\nIf you don\u2019t need to register, that\u2019s fine, but you still gotta keep some payroll records, which is just like paperwork for what you pay your people and all.\n\nNext up, when you pay your workers, you gotta take some deductions for PAYE. \n\n**Payments to your employees** are like what you pay them for working, plus any bonuses or tips (always nice to get tips, right?), or stuff like maternity pay. Don\u2019t forget that!\n\n**Deductions**? Yeah, you gotta take out tax and National Insurance from what they make. Sometimes there\u2019s stuff like student loans or pensions too\u2014lots to keep track of!\n\nSo, you need to tell HMRC (the tax peeps again) what you pay your employees and what you take out (these deductions) on or before payday. Your payroll software does the math for you, which is cool since numbers can be a pain. If a person makes more than \u00a3175 a week, you gotta add some more National Insurance for you too, the employer, which is kinda wild but necessary. \n\nAnd you\u2019ll pay HMRC usually monthly, but if you're a small fish and under \u00a31,500 a month, you can pay quarterly. Just call their helpline or whatever. \n\nYou gotta report stuff like when new employees join or if anyone has a life change like hitting retirement age or becoming a director. Annual reports are also a thing at the end of the tax year\u2014lots of boring details about expenses and benefits. Super fun, huh? \n\nSo how do you even run payroll? You can either just hire someone to do it\u2014or use software and wrangle things yourself. Either way, you gotta keep employee records because you can\u2019t just guess! Even if you pass it off to someone else, you\u2019re still in charge legally. \n\nWhat if you can\u2019t do it online? There are a few reasons you might not be able to, like if you have religious issues with tech or you\u2019re not computer-savvy. HMRC has guidelines for that if you wanna stick to paper.\n\nWhen you decide to go the DIY route, here\u2019s your to-do list:  \n1. Register as an employer to get a login for PAYE Online.  \n2. Pick a payroll software (there's lots!) to help out with the details and reporting.  \n3. Keep your employee records straight (super important).  \n4. Tell HMRC who your employees are.  \n5. Do the pay stuff and make sure to report to HMRC on time\u2014no lollygagging!  \n6. Pay the HMRC what you owe.\n\nYou also have to do some yearly reports for the next tax year that starts on April 6th again. \n\nNow about keeping records\u2014keep track of what you pay people, any deductions, reports you made to HMRC, sick leaves, and so on. You\u2019ve gotta keep everything neat for three years after the tax year because, like, they might check up on you! If not, they could slap you with a big fine, which stinks.\n\nIf your records go missing or whatever, you gotta tell HMRC ASAP and try to fix them back up, like figure out how much you paid staff based on whatever you can remember. \n\nOh, and don\u2019t forget about data protection stuff! If you store personal info, there are rules about that too\u2014gotta keep everyone\u2019s info safe and sound.",

      "body": "## Choosing schools \n\nIf you live in England contact [your local council](/find-your-local-council) to find:\n\n  * state-funded schools in your area\n  * [admission criteria](/schools-admissions/admissions-criteria) for the schools you\u2019re interested in\n\n\n\nThe process is different if you live in [Scotland](https://www.mygov.scot/register-your-child-for-a-school/), [Wales](https://gov.wales/school-admissions) or [Northern Ireland](https://www.eani.org.uk/parents/admissions).\n\nYou can also contact your local council to apply for places at state schools in other areas. You can search online to find [schools in England](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/).\n\n## Private schools or home schooling\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for [a place at a private school](https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school/private-schools) (also called \u2018independent schools\u2019), contact the school directly.\n\nYou can also choose to [teach your child at home](https://www.gov.uk/home-education), known as home schooling.\n\n## Children with an Education, Health and Care (EHC) plan\n\nIf your child has an Education, Health and Care (EHC) plan, it may name a school for them. A school named in the EHC plan must give your child a place.\n\n## Find out about a primary or secondary school\n\nYou can find out more by:\n\n  * visiting the school - most schools have open days\n  * reading the school\u2019s most recent [Ofsted reports](http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report)\n  * checking [school performance tables](http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/performance)\n  * talking to other parents about what they think of the school\n\n\n\n### What schools must publish on their website\n\nSchools\u2019 websites must include:\n\n  * admission arrangements, including how to apply\n  * details of the curriculum\n  * behaviour policy\n  * links to Ofsted reports\n  * links to performance data\n  * the school\u2019s latest key stage 2 and 4 attainment and progress measures\n  * their special educational needs (SEN) information report, which includes information about their policies for children or young people with [special educational needs and disabilities](/children-with-special-educational-needs)\n  * the amount of money they get for taking underprivileged children (the \u2018pupil premium\u2019), what they do with it and the effect it\u2019s had\n\n\n\nYou can also get advice about choosing state-funded schools from your [local council](/find-your-local-council).\n\n## Admission criteria \n\nAll schools have admission criteria to decide which children get places. The school or local council usually set these.\n\nAdmission criteria are different for each school. They may give priority to children:\n\n  * who live close to the school\n  * who have a brother or sister at the school already\n  * from a particular religion (for faith schools)\n  * who pass an entrance exam (for selective schools, for example grammar schools)\n  * who went to a particular primary school (a \u2018feeder school\u2019)\n  * who are eligible for the pupil premium or the service pupil premium\n  * whose parent has worked at the school for 2 years or more\n\n\n\nYour [local council](/find-your-local-council) can give you information about schools\u2019 criteria and how to apply.\n\n## Children in care\n\nAll state-funded schools must give top priority to admitting children who:\n\n  * are in care or being looked after\n  * have been in care\n\n\n\n## Complain about unfair admission arrangements\n\nContact the [Schools Adjudicator](http://www.education.gov.uk/schoolsadjudicator/howwecanhelp/a0076144/how-to-raise-an-objection-to-school-admission-arrangements) if you think a school has unlawful or unfair admission arrangements.\n\nYou need to complain by 15 May of the year before you\u2019re applying for a place. For example, to complain about admission arrangements for September 2021 the deadline is 15 May 2020.\n\n## School starting age \n\nMost children start reception full-time in September after their fourth birthday.\n\nFor example, if your child turns 4 in June, they\u2019ll usually start school in September that same year.\n\n## If you want your child to start later\n\nIf you do not think your child is ready to start school in September, they can start later. For example, if your child only turns 4 in August, you might decide to wait before sending them to school. But they must be in full-time education by the time they reach \u2018compulsory school age\u2019.\n\nThey can start:\n\n  * part time\n  * part-way through the year\n  * in the next school year, in the September after they turn 5\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll still need to [apply for a school place](/schools-admissions/how-to-apply) at the same time as everyone else. You can ask for a later start when you apply.\n\n### If your child starts in the September after they turn 5\n\nYour child will go into [year 1](/national-curriculum). Contact the local council or school if you want your child to start in reception instead. They do not have to agree.\n\n## Compulsory school age\n\nYour child must start full-time education once they reach compulsory school age. This is on 31 December, 31 March or 31 August following their fifth birthday - whichever comes first. If your child\u2019s fifth birthday is on one of those dates then they reach compulsory school age on that date.\n\nFor example, if your child reaches compulsory school age on 31 March, they must start full-time education at the beginning of the next term (summer term that year).\n\nChildren must stay in full-time education until they reach [school leaving age](/know-when-you-can-leave-school).\n\nAll 3 to 4-year-olds in England are entitled to [free early education](/help-with-childcare-costs/free-childcare-and-education-for-2-to-4-year-olds) before they start school full time.\n\n## How to apply \n\nFollow your local council\u2019s application process to:\n\n  * [apply for a primary school place](/apply-for-primary-school-place)\n  * [apply for a secondary school place](/apply-for-secondary-school-place)\n\n\n\nYou must still apply for a place, even if the school is linked to your child\u2019s current nursery, infant or primary school.\n\nApply directly for:\n\n  * a 6th form place at a school or college\n  * a place at a private school\n\n\n\n## Moving to another area\n\nYou apply through your local council even if you\u2019re applying for schools in another council area or you\u2019ve just moved to England.\n\nIf you\u2019re applying from another country, contact the local council in the area where you\u2019re going to live.\n\nYou may need to:\n\n  * supply proof of your new address, for example a mortgage or rental agreement or deeds for the property\n  * prove that you\u2019ll live in the area before the start of the next school term\n\n\n\n## Completing the application\n\nWhen you fill in the form (online or on paper) you\u2019ll be asked to list the schools you\u2019re applying for in order of preference.\n\nListing only one school will not increase your chances of getting a place there.\n\nTo get a copy of the application form on paper, [contact your local council](/find-your-local-council).\n\n## When to apply\n\nApplications open on different days in each local council area.\n\n### Applying for a primary school place\n\nYou must [apply for a primary school place](/apply-for-primary-school-place) a year before your child can start school. The [school starting age](/schools-admissions/school-starting-age) is 4. \n\nYour child will be 3 or have just turned 4 when you apply.\n\nThis is true even if you want your child to start later - you\u2019ll be able to ask for a later start when you apply. \n\nApplications open in September each year and close on 15 January.\n\n### Applying for a secondary school place\n\nApplications usually open on 1 September.

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so when you're thinkin' about schools in England, you\u2019ve gotta talk to your local council, you know? They\u2019ll help ya out with figuring out what state-funded schools are around you and all the boring rules about admissions for those schools.\n\nBut watch out! If you\u2019re in Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland, things get a bit different. Just saying.\n\nOh, and if you're fancy and want a private school, just hit them up directly, no need for the council. Or maybe you wanna homeschool your child? You can do that too, teaching from home and all that.\n\nNow, if your kid\u2019s got an Education, Health and Care (EHC) plan, it might say a specific school on it, and they gotta let your child in. Gotta follow that, right?\n\nWanna know if a primary or secondary school is any good? There are a few ways:\n- Go visit them for an open day or something.\n- Check their latest Ofsted reports; it\u2019s like a school review.\n- Look at their performance tables that show how they did recently.\n- Chat with other parents, get the gossip!\n\nBy the way, the schools have to show some info on their websites like how to apply, the curriculum stuff, their behaviour rules, Ofsted links, and how they help kids with special needs. They also gotta say what funds they get for underprivileged kids and how they spend it.\n\nNow, about admission criteria. Every school\u2019s got some rules on how they pick students. Usually, the council or the school makes the rules. For real, they might choose kids based on stuff like:\n- Who lives closest.\n- If you got a sibling there already.\n- If you\u2019re a faith school kid.\n- Good luck passing an entrance exam if they have one.\n- Network connections, who went to specific feeder primary schools.\n- Or if you get some kind of pupil premium support.\n\nOh, and if your kid's in care, they get top priority, easy-peasy.\n\nIf you think a school isn\u2019t playing fair with admissions, you can complain to the Schools Adjudicator, just make sure you do that before May 15th before you need a spot.\n\nNow, starting school. Kids usually go into reception when they turn 4, like, in the September after their birthday. So if they hit 4 in June, they\u2019ll start later that year.\n\nIf you\u2019re not ready for that, you can hold your child back until later. Must be in full-time education by the compulsory school age or whatever. That\u2019s 31 Dec, 31 March, or 31 Aug by the way. They gotta start school by then!\n\nWhen you apply for schools, do it through your local council. Even if you\u2019re moving to a new area, you still ask them. If you're coming from another country, that local council is your go-to too.\n\nFill in your application listing schools in order of what you want, but if you only pick one, it won\u2019t help.\n\nAnd when do applications open? For primary schools, you need to do that a year before, so like when your kid is 3 or just turning 4. They open in September and go until January 15th. For secondary schools, start applying by October 31st.\n\nAfter you apply, you\u2019ll know if you got a spot on specific dates, no later than April 16th for primaries and March 1st for secondaries. If you miss the deadline, good luck getting what you want!\n\nOh, and if your kid doesn\u2019t have a place, ask your council about waiting lists because they gotta keep them open for the first term at least.\n\nIf you\u2019re denied a spot, you can appeal, but you gotta follow some steps, and they have to give you a hearing and all that. It's like, you tell them why your kid should get in and there\u2019s a fair panel that\u2019ll decide.\n\nIf they deny your appeal, you can\u2019t just keep crying about it; you gotta follow a process if you want to complain about that too. \n\nBut hey, if a maintained school swaps to being an academy, it changes things a little for complaints and how they look into \u2018em.\n\nSo, yeah, lots to think about when picking schools. Just keep cool and check all your options, or it\u2019ll get stressful with all the deadlines! Good luck!",

[qualifying course](https://www.gov.uk/check-a-university-is-officially-recognised).\n\n## Your course\n\nCheck with your university or college if you\u2019re not sure whether your course qualifies for funding.\n\n### If you\u2019re studying full-time\n\nYou may be eligible for student finance if your course is in the UK and one of the following:\n\n  * a first degree, for example BA, BSc or BEd\n  * a Foundation Degree\n  * a Certificate of Higher Education\n  * a Diploma of Higher Education (DipHE)\n  * a Higher National Certificate (HNC)\n  * a Higher National Diploma (HND)\n  * an Initial Teacher Training course\n  * an integrated master\u2019s degree\n  * a pre-registration postgraduate healthcare course\n  * a level 4 or 5 course with Higher Technical Qualification approval\n\n\n\n### If you\u2019re studying part-time\n\nYour course [needs a \u2018course intensity\u2019 of 25% or more](/student-finance/parttime-students) for you to be eligible for student finance.\n\nYou may be eligible for a Tuition Fee Loan if your course is in the UK and one of the following:\n\n  * a first degree, for example BA, BSc or BEd\n  * a Foundation Degree\n  * a Certificate of Higher Education\n  * a Diploma of Higher Education (DipHE)\n  * a Higher National Certificate (HNC)\n  * a Higher National Diploma (HND)\n  * an Initial Teacher Training course\n  * an

approval\n\n\n\nYou are not eligible for student finance if you\u2019re doing a degree apprenticeship.\n\n## If you\u2019ve studied before\n\nYou\u2019ll usually only get student finance if you\u2019re doing your first higher education qualification - even if your previous course was self-funded. You may still be eligible for limited funding in certain circumstances and for some courses.\n\n### If you changed course, stopped your studies or are repeating a year\n\nIf you stopped your course within the first year, you\u2019ll get funding for the same course or a new course when you go back.\n\nYou might also get funding if you:\n\n  * suspended your course or withdrew before it finished - and you\u2019re going back to study any course\n  * are repeating a year of your course at the same university, college, or institution.\n\n\n\nIf you [stopped your studies for a personal reason](/student-finance-if-you-suspend-or-leave/getting-student-finance-while-you-suspend-your-studies) (for example, you were ill or pregnant) you might get funding for all of your course - you should [apply online with supporting evidence](/apply-for-student-finance). \n\n#### How to work out what funding you\u2019ll get\n\nIf you\u2019re eligible for Maintenance Loans or Grants, you should get them for every year of your new course.\n\nAny Tuition Fee Loans you\u2019re eligible for will be applied to the final years of your new course. You can calculate how many years you\u2019ll get them for by taking the total number of years you\u2019re applying for and adding one year. Then, take away the number of years you studied for previously. If you studied for part of a year, you should count it as a whole year.\n\n### Example\n\nIf you\u2019re applying for a 3 year course and have studied 2 years of a different course, you\u2019ll get a Maintenance Loan in year 1 and Tuition Fees and Maintenance Loans in years 2 and 3.\n\nIf you\u2019ve already completed a 3 year course but didn\u2019t gain a qualification and want to apply for another 3 year course, you\u2019ll get Maintenance Loans in years 1 and 2. You\u2019ll get Tuition Fees and Maintenance Loans in year 3.\n\n### If you already have a degree\n\nYou may be eligible for limited funding in certain circumstances.\n\nYou may get limited funding if you\u2019re \u2018topping up\u2019 a higher education qualification, for example you\u2019ve finished an HNC, HND or Foundation Degree and now want to do an Honours degree.\n\nYou may also get limited funding if you hold an Honours degree or a higher level of qualification and start a new course. This could be a part-time Honours degree, a joint Honours degree or an Integrated Master\u2019s degree in one of the following (or 2 if it\u2019s a joint Honours degree):\n\n  * agriculture and related subjects\n  * architecture (if it\u2019s a MArch RIBA Part 2 course)\n  * biological sciences\n  * computer science\n  * mathematical sciences\n  * medicine and allied subjects\n  * physical sciences\n  * technologies\n  * courses leading to qualification as a veterinary surgeon\n\n\n\nYou could also be eligible if you\u2019re starting a healthcare course on or after 1 August 2017.\n\n## Your age\n\nThere\u2019s no upper age limit for Tuition Fee Loans or grants. \n\n### If you\u2019re 60 or over\n\nYou may get limited funding for Maintenance Loans if all of the following apply:\n\n  * you\u2019re 60 or over on the first day of the first academic year of your \n\n\n\ncourse \n\n  * you\u2019re studying full-time\n  * your course started on or after 1 August 2016\n\n\n\nThe amount you can apply for depends on your household income.\n\n## Your nationality or residency status\n\nYou may be able to get help with: \n\n  * your tuition fees and living costs (full support)\n  * tuition fees (tuition fee-only funding) \n\n\n\nThe type of help you can get depends on your nationality and residency status.\n\n### If you\u2019re a UK national or Irish citizen or have \u2018settled status\u2019 in the UK\n\nYou can apply for full support if you meet the university, course and age requirements. Both of the following must also apply:\n\n  * your home is in England\n  * you\u2019ve been continuously living in the UK, Channel Islands or Isle of Man for 3 years before the [first day of your first academic year](/guidance/understanding-academic-years) (apart from temporary absences such as holidays)\n\n\n\n### If you have a different nationality or you live outside the UK\n\nUse the [undergraduate student finance checker](/check-what-undergraduate-student-finance-you-can-apply-for-depending-on-your-nationality-and-residency) to find out the type of help you can get depending on your nationality and residency status.

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so here's the deal about borrowing money for college, right? You can totally get loans for tuition fees and also some cash to help you live. If you're kinda broke or got kids or you're disabled, there might be a bit of extra money for you too, which is nice. And you don\u2019t even have to be from the UK to get student finance, which is kinda cool if you ask me. You should check out if you're eligible for all this stuff though. If you already have an account, just log in, easy peasy.\n\nNow, before you freak out and apply, there are some things to know. You only start paying back the loan after you earn over a certain amount, which is honestly pretty chill. The payments are based on your income not how much you actually owe, so that\u2019s something. Also, just remember that interest starts piling up from day one. And sometimes the rules change, which can be a bummer. There's a whole guide on it if you wanna dive into the details.\n\nIf your course started before September 2016, the rules are all different, so make sure you looked into that, yeah? You can also let someone else deal with applying for you if you want, like if you have power of attorney or something like that.\n\nTo apply, again, check out how to do that. If you're under 25 and not talking to your parents, you can apply as an \u2018estranged student\u2019 which is just fancy talk for \u2018you don\u2019t get help from home\u2019. If you were in care for a bit, there\u2019s a thing called a \u2018care leaver\u2019 status too.\n\nBy the way, if you\u2019re not from England, you gotta follow different steps depending on where you're from, like Scotland or Wales or Northern Ireland. So just check those links if needed.\n\nNow, if you\u2019re a brand-spanking-new full-time student, you can snag both a Tuition Fee Loan and a Maintenance Loan if your course starts after August 1, 2016. The tuition fee is set by your uni, and it gets paid straight to them, but don't forget; you\u2019ll have to pay it back eventually. You can borrow up to \u00a39,250 if you are full-time and if you're into accelerated degrees, it might go up to \u00a311,100.\n\nTalking about living costs, you gotta tell them how much your household makes and the start date of your course. It's supposed to help you manage, and they slap that money directly into your bank account at the start of each term. Always gotta pay it back, of course. If you\u2019re getting distance learning, there\u2019s a catch: you can only go for the Maintenance Loan if you aren't able to go in because of a disability. \n\nNow, how much cash you can get depends on where you are living, like if you\u2019re at home or away, and it changes year to year. For this academic year, if you're living with parents, max cash is around \u00a38,400, while if you\u2019re in London, it\u2019s more like \u00a313,022. They got a handy student finance calculator if you wanna figure stuff out too.  Sometimes though, you won\u2019t get all the money and might need to do some part-time work or get help from family or local councils.\n\nOh, and you gotta let them know if your living situation changes, so they can adjust your student finance or whatever. You might need to back that up with some proof, which they really like seeing.\n\nAlso, there are grants for travel costs if you live in England but are studying away. And if you're in certain healthcare courses, you can get help with travel for clinical stuff too, if that applies to you.\n\nThere\u2019s loads of info on what loans and help you can get, depending on if you\u2019re continuing from a previous course or if you\u2019re just starting out. Just check what applies to your timeline. And hey, if you're doing part-time study, you can totally still get loans too, but only if your course intensity is high enough.\n\nFor all this fun, just keep looking at the links for specific numbers and rules because they can be a bit much sometimes. If you\u2019re a bit confused or unsure, it\u2019s all good, just ask your uni or look up the info. Oh, and make sure you know if you can apply for different grants or stuff too depending on your situation like having kids or being disabled. \n\nSo yeah, good luck with all the money stuff, and don\u2019t forget to apply on time!",

If you get too much money by mistake because your situation or course changes or something, you might have to pay back what\u2019s extra. Yikes!\n\n### What you could get \n\nFor the 2024-2025 school year, you might be able to snag between \u00a350 and \u00a31,963 a year, which is a pretty big range. Normally, they dish it out in 3 chunks straight to your bank account, one for each term. Remember, it\u2019s on top of the other student money and still no pay back needed. \n\nOh, and last year (2023-2024), full-time students could\u2019ve gotten up to \u00a31,915, which is good to know!  \n\n### Who can get it\n\nSo, you can qualify for Parents\u2019 Learning Allowance if:\n\n- You\u2019re studying in England (major requirement, right?)\n- You have kids that depend on you \n- You\u2019re enrolled in a full-time undergrad or Initial Teacher Training course, whatever that is.\n- Your household income is under this pretty specific number, \u00a318,835.98 a year. \n\nAnd by the way, you don\u2019t even have to pay for childcare to be in the running for this, like how easy is that?  \n\n### How to go for it\n\nYou can apply for this Parents\u2019 Learning Allowance when you apply for student finance, which is super convenient honestly. \n\n### After you throw your application in\n\nOnce you apply, you\u2019ll get a letter that tells you how much cash you can expect.

      "poorly_written_article": "So, like, if you\u2019re getting certain benefits, you might be able to get these Cold Weather Payments, right? It\u2019s super simple because you don\u2019t even have to apply for them! Just sit back and relax... unless you have a baby, then you gotta tell Jobcentre Plus or something. And don\u2019t worry, these payments won\u2019t mess with your other benefits, cool? \n\nYou\u2019ll get a payment if it\u2019s freezing - like when it\u2019s zero degrees Celsius or less for 7 days straight. Frigid! You get \u00a325 each week of that cold spell between November 1, 2024, and March 31, 2025. Just check your weather\u2014look it up by postcode or whatever. There\u2019s a link for that. \n\nOh, and, uh, just to clarify, Cold Weather Payments are NOT the same as Winter Fuel Payments. Totally different, got it? \n\nIf you\u2019re in Scotland, just forget about Cold Weather Payments. You can only get this annual thing called the Winter Heating Payment instead, which is kinda nice because it doesn\u2019t depend on the weather, so yay for that!\n\nNow, who\u2019s eligible for these payments anyway? It\u2019s mostly folks getting Pension Credit, Income Support, income-based Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA), income-related Employment Support Allowance (ESA), Universal Credit, or Support for Mortgage Interest. But, like, if you\u2019re in Scotland, ignore all that because you won\u2019t get Cold Weather Payments! \n\nYou\u2019d usually get these payments as long as you\u2019re getting Pension Credit or if you\u2019re on Income Support or income-based JSA and you have stuff like a disability, or a kid who is disabled, or even just a kid under 5 at home. \n\nNow for the ESA zone, if you\u2019re getting that income-related stuff and you\u2019re in one of the activity groups, you\u2019re good to go! But it doesn\u2019t stop there; even if you\u2019re not in any group, you can still get payments if you meet certain conditions. Like really, it\u2019s worth checking out.\n\nFor Universal Credit, you\u2019ll likely see these payments if you\u2019re not working at all, or if your partner isn\u2019t working. There\u2019s more to it, but if you have a kid or a health condition, you\u2019re probably fine. So, yeah.\n\nAlright, so you don\u2019t need to do much to get your payments. Just chill. But, wait, if you have a newborn or a little one moves in, absolutely let Jobcentre Plus know! Otherwise, it\u2019s not automatic. Just keep that in mind.\n\nWhen are the payments coming? If it\u2019s super cold for those 7 days and you\u2019re eligible, you\u2019ll get a \u00a325 payment pretty quickly\u2014usually within 14 days after the cold period ends. It\u2019ll go right into your usual bank account with your other benefits, easy peasy. \n\nIf you\u2019re waiting for your money and it\u2019s, like, missing or something, tell the Pension Service or Jobcentre Plus, because something might\u2019ve gone wrong. \n\nAlso, if you end up in the hospital, give them a heads up too, since that might affect your payments. And again, with Universal Credit, go online or call them if you can\u2019t log in. They really want to know where you are, I guess? \n\nSo, just keep an eye on the weather, let the right folks know about any changes, and you should be golden for those Cold Weather Payments!",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, like, if you're between 16 and 19 and going to a school or college in England, not a uni tho, you might be able to snag a bursary to help with school stuff. This includes things like clothes and books and even getting to school sometimes. Uh, technically a publicly funded school just means they don\u2019t make you pay to go there, so that\u2019s cool I guess. Oh, and the whole bursary scene is different in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, so don\u2019t forget that.\n\nIf you\u2019re already 19, you can still qualify if you\u2019re doing a course that you started when you were younger, like from 16 to 18. Or if you have one of those Education, Health and Care Plans, which, I mean, I have no idea what those all cover, but it\u2019s probably important.\n\nNow, speaking of bursaries, they\u2019re basically just money to help you pay for stuff like transport, books, and food when you\u2019re at school or training. Yeah, it\u2019s all about helping you out with costs associated with your education, ya know?\n\nSo, there\u2019re two types of bursaries for 16 to 19 year olds: the bursary for vulnerable students, which could give you up to like \u00a31,200 depending on your situation, and then there\u2019s a discretionary bursary which, honestly, can vary a lot because it\u2019s up to your school or provider to decide how much you get.\n\nIf you\u2019re over 19, you\u2019ll just be going for that discretionary bursary. The way you\u2019ll get your money might change too, they could just give you cash, or maybe a travel pass or something, who knows? And sometimes they might just hand over a bunch of cash for things like trips or interviews for college.\n\nBut listen, if you break any of the rules, like skipping classes or using the money wrong, they can totally stop giving you that bursary. So, keep that in mind! \n\nTo be eligible, you gotta be at least 16 but not older than 19 on August 31, 2024. You have to be at a public school or on some unpaid training thing. And make sure to figure out residency stuff with your school.\n\nVulnerable groups can get a bursary if you\u2019re in care or just left it, or if you\u2019re getting some kind of support like Income Support or Universal Credit. There are a few other financial support scenarios that could get you this cash too, but you probably get the idea.\n\nWhen looking for discretionary bursaries, every school or college is different and they\u2019ll check your family income or whatever. So just hit up student services to figure out how that all works.\n\nTo actually apply, just go to your school or whatever and ask them how to get started. It\u2019s best to apply when you know where you\u2019ll study so that checks don\u2019t slow you down. \n\nAnd like, you might have to reapply every year, so just keep that on your radar.\n\nIf you\u2019re confused or need to complain about decisions that don\u2019t seem fair or whatever, go talk to student services. They\u2019ll guide you or make you go through some complaint process if needed.\n\nLastly, if you\u2019re in a tight spot or something changes in your life, you might qualify for more help or an emergency fund. So definitely reach out if things get tricky!",

      "body": "## Overview \n\nApprentices are aged 16 or over and combine working with studying to gain skills and knowledge in a specific job.\n\nThis guidance is for employers in England. There\u2019s a different way to employ an:\n\n  * [apprentice in Scotland](http://www.apprenticeship.scot/)\n  * [apprentice in Wales](https://businesswales.gov.wales/skillsgateway/apprenticeships)\n  * [apprentice in Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/campaigns/apprenticeships)\n\n\n\nApprentices can be new or current employees.\n\nYou must pay the apprentice at least [the minimum wage](/national-minimum-wage-rates).\n\nApprenticeships must last at least a year. They can last up to 5 years depending on the level the apprentice is studying.\n\n## Your responsibilities\n\nYou\u2019re responsible for making sure your apprentice:\n\n  * works with experienced staff\n  * learns job-specific skills\n  * gets time off during their working week for apprenticeship training\n\n\n\n## Hiring an apprentice\n\nThere are several steps to taking on an apprentice.\n\n  1. [Choose an apprenticeship](https://findapprenticeshiptraining.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/) for your business or organisation.\n\n  2. [Find an organisation that offers training](https://findapprenticeshiptraining.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/) for the apprenticeship you\u2019ve chosen.\n\n  3. Check what [training funding you can get](/take-on-an-apprentice/get-funding).\n\n  4. [Create an account](/employing-an-apprentice/create-an-account) \\- you need this to manage funding and recruit apprentices.\n\n  5. Advertise your apprenticeship - [find out how to create an advert](/guidance/creating-an-apprenticeship-advert) or give your training provider permission to do this for you.\n\n  6. [Make an apprenticeship agreement and training plan](/employing-an-apprentice/apprenticeship-agreement) with your chosen apprentice.\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not want to hire and train the apprentice yourself, you can use a [flexi-job apprenticeship agency](/government/publications/register-of-flexi-job-apprenticeship-agencies). The apprentice will be employed by the agency but will work in your organisation.\n\n## Get funding for apprenticeship training \n\nYou can get help from the government to pay for apprenticeship training.\n\nYou might be able to get an additional payment of \u00a31,000, depending on the apprentice you hire.\n\n## What funding you can get\n\nYou can get money to go towards the cost of training and assessment. The amount you get depends on whether you pay the apprenticeship levy or not.\n\nFind out if you need to [pay the apprenticeship levy](/guidance/pay-apprenticeship-levy).\n\n### If you do not pay the apprenticeship levy\n\nYou pay 5% towards the cost of training and assessing your apprentice. You need to:\n\n  * agree a payment schedule with the training provider\n  * pay them directly for the training\n\n\n\nThe government will pay the rest (95%) up to the [funding band maximum](/government/publications/apprenticeship-funding/apprenticeship-funding). They\u2019ll pay it directly to the training provider.\n\nIf your apprentice started before 1 April 2019, you contribute 10% towards the cost of training and assessing your apprentice and the government pays the rest (90%). This rate continues until your apprentice completes their training.\n\nUse your [apprenticeships service account](/employing-an-apprentice/create-an-account) to manage funding and provider payments.\n\nThe cost of training and assessing your apprentice could be fully funded, up to the funding band maximum, depending on both your and your apprentice\u2019s circumstances. [Check the funding rules](/guidance/apprenticeship-funding-rules) to see if you\u2019re eligible.\n\n### If you pay the apprenticeship levy\n\nYou\u2019ll get funds to spend on training and assessing your apprentices. The government will add 10%.\n\nFind out how to [pay the apprenticeship levy](/guidance/pay-apprenticeship-levy).\n\nUse your [apprenticeships service account](/employing-an-apprentice/create-an-account) to manage funding and provider payments.\n\nYou cannot use funds from your apprenticeship service account to pay for a flexi-job apprenticeship agency\u2019s services.\n\n## Help to pay for other costs\n\nYou can get \u00a31,000 to support your apprentice in the workplace if, at the start of their apprenticeship training, they are one of the following:\n\n  * 16 to 18 years old (or 15 years old if the apprentice\u2019s 16th birthday is between the last Friday of June and 31 August)\n\n  * 19 to 24 years old with an education, health and care (EHC) plan \n\n  * 19 to 24 years old and have been in care\n\n\n\n\nYou can spend it on any costs related to their employment, for example their salary, travel costs or uniform.\n\n### How and when you\u2019ll be paid\n\nThe training provider will pay you once they\u2019ve confirmed that an apprentice is eligible. You\u2019ll be paid in 2 instalments of \u00a3500.\n\nYou\u2019ll get the first payment 90 days after the apprenticeship started and the second payment one year after the apprenticeship started. (Training providers must pay you within 30 working days of receiving the money from the government.)\n\nYou\u2019ll only get paid if the apprentice is still employed by you when the payment is due.\n\nIf an apprentice has an education, health and care (EHC) plan or has been in care, the training provider must get the apprentice\u2019s agreement before sharing this information with you. The training provider will also need this agreement before making any payments to you.\n\n## Create an account \n\nYou need to create an apprenticeships service account. You\u2019ll use this service to:\n\n  * advertise apprenticeships\n  * accept employer agreements with the Department for Education (DfE)\n  * give account access to people within your organisation\n  * set permissions for training providers to allow them to do some things on your behalf (such as advertising apprenticeships)\n\n\n\nYou can also use this service to add details about:\n\n  * your organisation(s) or company\n  * your PAYE scheme\n  * your apprentices\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll need a GOV.UK One Login to set up or access an account. You can create one in the service using a work email address.\n\n[ Start now ](https://accounts.manage-apprenticeships.service.gov.uk/service)\n\n## Before you start\n\nYou\u2019ll need either your organisation\u2019s:\n\n  * Government Gateway username and ID number\n  * PAYE scheme reference number and Accounts Office Reference Number (AORN)\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll also need to provide your:\n\n  * Companies House number, charity number or public body name\n  * email address\n  * PAYE scheme details\n\n## Make an apprenticeship agreement \n\nYou must sign an apprenticeship agreement with your apprentice.\n\nThis gives details of:\n\n  * the skill, trade or occupation the apprentice is being trained for\n  * the name of the apprenticeship they\u2019re working towards\n  * the start and end dates for the apprenticeship\n  * the amount of training you\u2019ll give them\n\n\n\nYou can write your own apprentice agreement or [download an apprenticeship agreement template](/government/publications/apprenticeship-agreement-template).\n\n## Training plan\n\nYou must sign a training plan with your apprentice and the training provider.\n\nYou can write your own plan or use the [apprenticeship training plan template](/government/publications/apprenticeships-off-the-job-training).\n\nIt must include:\n\n  * the planned content and schedule for training\n  * what is expected and offered by the employer, the training provider and the apprentice\n  * how to resolve queries or complaints\n\n\n\n## If the apprentice has relevant experience\n\nYour apprentice could spend less time training or qualify earlier if they have relevant experience. The training provider will tell you which it will be, depending on how the training is delivered.\n\nRelevant experience includes having:\n\n  * qualifications, such as a National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) in a relevant subject\n  * industry or sector experience\n  * completed training, such as an IT course\n\n\n\nIf the amount of training is reduced, you must agree this with both the training provider and the apprentice during [the initial assessment](https://www.apprenticeships.gov.uk/employers/prepare-for-the-initial-assessment).\n\n## Pay and conditions for apprentices \n\nYou are responsible for:\n\n  * giving your apprentice their contract of employment\n  * paying your apprentice\u2019s wage\n  * signing an [apprenticeship agreement](/employing-an-apprentice/apprenticeship-agreement)\n\n\n\n## Pay for apprentices\n\nYou must pay apprentices at least the [National Minimum Wage](/national-minimum-wage/employers-and-the-minimum-wage).\n\nThere are different rates of pay for apprentices depending on their age and what year of their apprenticeship they\u2019ve completed.\n\nThe contract of employment should make it clear what wage you\u2019ll pay your apprentice and for what hours.\n\n### Aged 16 to 18\n\nThe current [National Minimum Wage](/national-minimum-wage-rates) rate for an apprentice is \u00a36.40 per hour.\n\n### Aged 19 or over and in their first year\n\nThe current [National Minimum Wage](/national-minimum-wage-rates) rate for an apprentice is \u00a36.40 per hour.\n\n### Aged 19 or over and have completed their first year\n\nApprentices will be entitled to the [National Minimum Wage or National Living Wage rate](/national-minimum-wage-rates) for their age.\n\nUse the [National Minimum Wage and Living Wage calculator](https://www.gov.uk/am-i-getting-minimum-wage) to check if you\u2019re paying your apprentices correctly.\n\n## Conditions\n\nApprentices must work towards an [approved apprenticeship](https://findapprenticeshiptraining.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/). Their training must last at least 12 months.\n\nThey must be employed in a real job that gives them the opportunity to gain the knowledge and skills they need to pass their assessment.\n\n### Training and study\n\nYou must pay your apprentice for time spent training or studying for their apprenticeship.\n\nApprentices must get time off during their working week for apprenticeship training.\n\nThe training might take place:\n\n  * at their place of work\n  * somewhere else (for example, a college or training provider)\n  * online\n\n\n\nIf your apprentice is also studying for English or maths qualifications required by their apprenticeship, they are entitled to paid study time during their normal working hours.\n\n### Employee rights\n\nYou must offer apprentices the same conditions as other employees working at similar grades or in similar roles. This includes:\n\n  * paid holidays\n  * sick pay\n  * any benefits you offer such as childcare voucher schemes\n  * any support you offer such as coaching or mentoring\n\n\n\n## Apprentices and redundancy\n\nApprentices have the same employment rights as your other employees. Follow the process for [making staff redundant](/staff-redundant) if you have to make an apprentice redundant.\n\n[Get legal advice](/find-a-legal-adviser) if you want to end the apprenticeship early for another reason.\n\n### Support for apprentices\n\nYour apprentice can get support if they\u2019re being made redundant or are at risk of redundancy.\n\nThey can get:\n\n  * financial and legal advice\n  * support for their health and wellbeing\n  * help finding another apprenticeship\n\n\n\nDfE Apprenticeships and Skills Helpline  \nTelephone: 0800 015 0400  \nMonday to Friday, 9am to 5pm\n\n## Get help employing an apprentice \n\nYou can get more information on the [employer support site](https://help.employersupport.apprenticeships.gov.uk/hc/en-gb).\n\nIf you still need help, contact the employer support service.\n\nEmployer support service   \nTelephone: 0800 015 0400  \nMonday to Friday, 9am to 5pm  \n[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)",

      "poorly_written_article": "So like, apprentices are basically people who are 16 and older and they do this cool thing where they work but also go to school at the same time to learn stuff for a specific job, you know? So, if you\u2019re an employer in England, this is for you. But just to be clear, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland do their own thing with apprenticeships, so just click some links if you wanna know about that (here they are: Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland)! \n\nApprentices can be new hires or they can already work for you, good old current employees (yup, that's right). Also, you gotta pay them at least the minimum wage cause, like, that's what you do, right? And apprenticeships have to last at least a year, but sometimes they can stretch up to 5 years if the apprentice is leveling up their studies.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk responsibilities. As an employer, it\u2019s on you to make sure your apprentice:\n  * Works with some experienced peeps, like someone who really knows their stuff.\n  * Learns skills that are specifically for the job, kinda like how in school you learn what's on the syllabus but for work.\n  * Gets time off for training during their workweek, 'cause that's pretty important.\n\nWhen hiring an apprentice, there\u2019s a few steps:\n  1. Pick out an apprenticeship that matches your business (like, what\u2019s your vibe?). \n  2. Find a training organization that offers what you wanna do.\n  3. Check out what money you can get for training (hint: there might be funding!). \n  4. Create an account online (no biggie, just for managing stuff).\n  5. Advertise your apprenticeship. You can do it yourself or let your training provider take care of that for you.\n  6. Finally, make an agreement and a training plan with your apprentice. \n\nIf you\u2019re not really into the whole direct hire thing, just go ahead and find a flexi-job apprenticeship agency. They will handle the hiring but your apprentice works for you. \n\nAlso, there's government help for training costs! You might score an extra \u00a31,000 if the apprentice checks certain boxes like age or previous care experience. If you don\u2019t pay the apprenticeship levy, you cover a small percentage (like 5%) of the training costs while the government takes care of the rest (95%). If you do pay that levy, you get to use those funds for training too! \n\nAnd you know, if your apprentice is really young (like, 16-18) or has some plans/experiences going on, you might even get this money to help with their pay or other job-related costs, which is nice! \n\nWhen it comes to pay, there are set rates depending on age and apprenticeship year \u2014 for example, 16 to 18-year-olds might get around \u00a36.40 an hour. But you need to check this stuff out to be sure! \n\nAnd like, don\u2019t forget you gotta give apprentices the same benefits as any other employee, meaning sick pay, holidays, and whatever perks you offer. \n\nIf your apprentice gets in a jam (like redundancy), they have the same rights as regular employees. And guess what? The government has helplines if they need a hand with anything or if they\u2019re feeling stressed. \n\nIf you need help, the DfE has a support line and you can hit them up from 9 to 5, Monday to Friday. No worries, the info is all out there for ya!",

But the fun part? You can take on apprentices whether they're brand-spanking new to your company or have been around a while! Just make sure to cough up at least the minimum wage, right?

The start date must be one of the following:\n\n  * the actual date of birth\n  * a specified number of days after the birth \n  * a set date which is after the date of birth\n\n\n\nLeave must finish within 52 weeks of the birth (or due date, if the baby is early).\n\nThe start and end dates are different [if the employee is adopting](/employers-paternity-pay-leave/adoption).\n\nThere are different rules [if you\u2019re in Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/paternity-leave).\n\n## Statutory Paternity Pay\n\nStatutory Paternity Pay for eligible employees is either \u00a3184.03 a week or 90% of their average weekly earnings (whichever is lower). Tax and National Insurance need to be deducted.\n\nCalculate an employee\u2019s paternity leave and pay using the [maternity and paternity calculator](/maternity-paternity-calculator).\n\nSome employment types, like agency workers, directors and educational workers, have [different rules for entitlement](/statutory-paternity-pay-employment-types-that-affect-payment).\n\n## Extra leave or pay\n\nEmployees can get more leave or pay if:\n\n  * their partner returns to work and they qualify for [Shared Parental Leave and Pay](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay-employer-guide)\n  * your company scheme offers more\n\n\n\nYou must make sure your paternity leave and pay policies are clear and easily accessible to staff.\n\n## Reclaiming payments\n\nEven if you pay an employee more than the statutory amount, you can usually only reclaim 92% of that amount. You may be able to reclaim 103% if you qualify for Small Employers\u2019 Relief.

This is different [if the employee is adopting](/paternity-leave-pay-employees/adoption).\n\nUse the [paternity pay calculator](/maternity-paternity-calculator) to check an employee\u2019s eligibility and work out their relevant period, notice period and paternity pay.\n\nThere are [special rules](/statutory-paternity-pay-employee-circumstances-that-affect-payment) for some employee situations, for example if they leave or become sick.\n\n## If the child is born early\n\nIf the child is born early, the employee is still eligible if they would have worked for you continuously for at least 26 weeks by the qualifying week.\n\n## Employees in surrogacy arrangements\n\nParents intending to have a child through a surrogacy arrangement may be eligible for Statutory Paternity Pay and Leave.\n\nIf you ask, they must give you a written statement to confirm that they\u2019ve applied or intend to apply for a [parental order](/become-a-childs-legal-parent) in the 6 months after the baby\u2019s birth.\n\n## Notice period \n\nThe notice periods and forms are different [if the employee is adopting](/paternity-leave-pay-employees/adoption).\n\n## Statutory Paternity Leave\n\nFor babies expected before or on 6 April 2024, employees must tell you at least 15 weeks before the baby is expected:\n\n  * the due date\n  * when they want their leave to start\n  * how much leave they want\n\n\n\nFor babies expected after 6 April 2024, employees must tell you the due date at least 15 weeks before the baby is expected. They must tell you when they want their leave to start, and how much leave they want to take, at least 28 days before.\n\nNotice does not have to be in writing unless you request it.\n\nEmployees can ask for leave and pay in writing using [the online form](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/fill-online/apply-for-statutory-paternity-pay). This replaces form SC3. Employees will need to download or print the form after completing it and give you a copy.\n\n## Statutory Paternity Pay\n\nEmployees must claim paternity pay at least 15 weeks before the week the baby is expected.\n\nNotice does not have to be in writing unless you request it.\n\nEmployees can ask for leave and pay in writing using [the online form](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/fill-online/apply-for-statutory-paternity-pay).

To delay it, write to them within 28 days of their leave request.\n\n## Adoption \n\nEligible employees are [entitled to paternity leave and pay](/paternity-leave-pay-employees/entitlement) if they\u2019re adopting a child.\n\nCalculate an employee\u2019s paternity leave and pay using the [maternity and paternity calculator](/maternity-paternity-calculator). For overseas adoptions you\u2019ll need to use your payroll software (if it has this feature) or [work it out manually](/statutory-paternity-pay-manually-calculate-your-employees-payments).\n\n## Eligibility\n\nAn employee adopting a child must:\n\n  * have been [continuously employed by you](/continuous-employment-what-it-is) for at least 26 weeks up to any day in the week they were matched with a child (UK adoptions)\n  * have been continuously employed by you for at least 26 weeks by either the date the child arrives in the UK or when they want their pay to start (overseas adoptions)\n  * confirm that their partner is getting Statutory Adoption Pay in writing or by giving you a copy of their partner\u2019s [form SC6](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/statutory-adoption-pay-and-leave-adopting-a-child-from-abroad-sc6)\n  * meet the other [eligibility conditions](/paternity-leave-pay-employees/eligibility) for paternity leave or pay\n\n\n\n## Notice period\n\nAn employee adopting a child can send you [form SC4](/government/publications/ordinary-statutory-paternity-pay-and-leave-becoming-an-adoptive-parent-sc4) (or your own version) for:\n\n  * leave - no later than 7 days of their co-adopter or partner being matched with a child\n  * pay - 28 days, or as soon as they\u2019re reasonably able, before they want their pay to start\n\n\n\nFor overseas adoptions the form and notice period is different. The process is explained on [form SC5](/government/publications/ordinary-statutory-paternity-pay-and-leave-adopting-a-child-from-abroad-sc5).\n\n## Leave start date\n\nAn employee taking paternity leave because they\u2019re adopting can start their leave:\n\n  * on the date of placement\n  * an agreed number of days after the date of placement\n  * on the date the child arrives in the UK or an agreed number of days after this (overseas adoptions)\n\n\n\nLeave must be taken within:\n\n  * 56 days of the date of placement or the child\u2019s arrival in the UK (for overseas adoptions) - for children who are placed or arrive before 6 April 2024\n  * 52 weeks of the date of placement or arrival - for children who are placed or arrive on or after 6 April 2024\n\n\n\n## Proof of adoption\n\nEmployees must give you proof of adoption to qualify for paternity pay. Proof is not needed for paternity leave unless you request it. Proof can be a letter from their adoption agency or their matching certificate.\n\nYou must [keep records](/employers-paternity-pay-leave/records) of the proof.\n\n## Refuse pay form SPP1 \n\nYou can refuse Statutory Paternity Pay if the employee does not qualify. To do this send them [form SPP1](/government/publications/ordinary-statutory-paternity-pay-non-payment-explanation-ospp1) within 28 days of their pay request. You must keep a copy.\n\nThe employee can ask you for a written statement explaining your decision. You have to give this to them within a reasonable time, for example 7 working days.\n\n## Record keeping \n\nYou must keep records for HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), including:\n\n  * the date Statutory Paternity Pay started\n  * the paternity payments you\u2019ve made (including dates)\n  * the [payments you\u2019ve reclaimed](/recover-statutory-payments)\n  * any weeks you did not pay and why\n  * if adopting, a letter from the adoption agency or a matching certificate\n\n\n\nYou must keep records for 3 years from the end of the tax year they relate to (for example by using [form SPP2](/government/publications/statutory-paternity-pay-record-sheet-spp2) or keeping your own records).\n\n## Help with statutory pay \n\nFor [financial help with statutory pay](/recover-statutory-payments), you can:\n\n  * reclaim payments (usually 92%)\n  * apply for an advance if you cannot afford payments\n\n\n  *[HMRC]: HM Revenue and Customs",

      "poorly_written_article": "So like, this is all about the whole paternity leave thing for employees when they're having kids or adopting or getting a kid through surrogacy, ya know? If you or your partner is due a baby or something, you could possibly be eligible for Statutory Paternity Leave and Pay, which is nice. \n\nNow, if your baby is arriving before or on April 6, 2024 (which is not that far away), you can take either 1 week or 2 weeks off. But it's the same amount of time no matter how many kids you have; like twins, for example. But the leave can't kick off until the baby is actually born. The start day has to be one of these \u2013 the actual birth date, a few days after the baby arrives, or however many days after when the baby was supposedly gonna come. Plus, you have to finish the leave within 56 days of the baby being born, or if the baby comes super early, then go with the due date. Simple, right?\n\nIf the baby is due after April 6, 2024, then, it\u2019s still 1 or 2 weeks of leave, but hey, if you want the 2 weeks, you can take them separately, how cool is that? Still can't start before the big event, and the same rules apply about start dates as before, and the finish time is within 52 weeks after birth, which is a bit longer than before. Just keep in mind that the rules change a bit for adoption too, so if you're adopting, go check those out!\n\nWhen it comes to Statutory Paternity Pay, which is pretty much the money you get when you're on leave, it\u2019s either \u00a3184.03 a week or 90% of what you usually make, but like whichever is less, ya know? Gotta consider taxes too, ugh basic adult stuff. There's a calculator online to help with these calculations and also note that some jobs like agency work or educational roles have their own rules.\n\nOkay, so if you have a partner who goes back to work, there are options to get more leave or pay. People gotta know your leave policies for paternity and stuff, so that\u2019s important too! \n\nAnd hey, if you go to antenatal appointments with a pregnant lady, you can take some unpaid time off! You don\u2019t wanna just ditch her, right? Like, you gotta be the father or husband or partner or just someone who\u2019s close for this to work.\n\nNow, even if the baby doesn\u2019t make it through pregnancy, you still can take leave and get some payment, which is really good to know I guess. Your job rights remain safe while you\u2019re on leave too, even if your employer stops operating, so that's kinda a relief.\n\nTo be eligible, you gotta be either the dad, mom's partner, adoptive parent, or planned parent through surrogacy, plus there's other stuff like you need to be an employee, not just some random guy. You should have been working for at least 26 weeks before that due date to qualify for the pay part. And then, you gotta give your boss a heads up with notice, which is like 15 weeks in advance in most cases. No biggie, just an email or talk it out with them.  \n\nIf the kid comes early, don\u2019t sweat it, as long as you met the employment time beforehand, you're good. \n\nThen there\u2019s the whole deal about kids coming through surrogacy, and those parents might also qualify for pay and leave. If they ask for it, they gotta show a paper saying they plan to become legal parents or whatever.\n\nFor notice, if you\u2019re adopting, you gotta let them know about 7 days after being matched, which is real soon! They also need to have a good reason if they tell you late, or else you can hold their leave.\n\nAnd check this \u2013 keeping track of records is a must. The HMRC wants details about money and dates of payments and whatnot, and you gotta keep that stuff for 3 years, which feels like a lot of work but necessary. \n\nIf you\u2019re struggling with the money stuff or just need help, there are ways to reclaim some cash for payments, and maybe even ask for an advance. That\u2019s about it, really. Hope this helps out or whatever!",

This includes your right to:\n\n  * pay rises\n  * build up (accrue) holiday\n  * return to work\n\n## Leave \n\nStatutory Maternity Leave is 52 weeks. It\u2019s made up of:\n\n  * Ordinary Maternity Leave - first 26 weeks\n  * Additional Maternity Leave - last 26 weeks\n\n\n\nYou do not have to take 52 weeks but you must take 2 weeks\u2019 leave after your baby is born (or 4 weeks if you work in a factory).\n\nUse the [maternity planner](/pay-leave-for-parents) to work out the dates for your ordinary and additional leave.\n\nYou may be entitled to take some of your leave as [Shared Parental Leave](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay).\n\n## Start date and early births\n\nUsually, the earliest you can start your leave is 11 weeks before the expected week of childbirth.\n\nLeave will also start:\n\n  * the day after the birth if the baby is early\n  * automatically if you\u2019re off work for a pregnancy-related illness in the 4 weeks before the week (Sunday to Saturday) that your baby is due\n\n\n\nUse the [maternity planner](/pay-leave-for-parents) to work out the earliest date your maternity leave can start.\n\n## Change your date for returning to work\n\nYou must give your employer at least 8 weeks\u2019 notice if you want to change your return to work date.\n\n## Pay \n\nStatutory Maternity Pay (SMP) is paid for up to 39 weeks. You get:\n\n  * 90% of your average weekly earnings (before tax) for the first 6 weeks\n  * \u00a3184.03 or 90% of your average weekly earnings (whichever is lower) for the next 33 weeks\n\n\n\nSMP is paid in the same way as your wages (for example monthly or weekly). Tax and National Insurance will be deducted.\n\nUse the [maternity pay calculator](/pay-leave-for-parents) to work out how much you could get.\n\nIf you take [Shared Parental Leave](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay) you\u2019ll get Statutory Shared Parental Pay (ShPP). ShPP is \u00a3184.03 a week or 90% of your average weekly earnings, whichever is lower.\n\n## Start date\n\nSMP usually starts when you take your maternity leave.\n\nIt starts automatically if you\u2019re off work for a pregnancy-related illness in the 4 weeks before the week (Sunday to Saturday) that your baby is due.\n\n## Problems and disputes\n\nAsk your employer to explain your SMP if you think it\u2019s not right. If you disagree about the amount or your employer cannot pay (for example because they\u2019re insolvent), [contact the Statutory Payment Disputes Team](/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/statutory-payment-dispute-team).\n\n## Eligibility \n\n## Statutory Maternity Leave\n\nYou qualify for Statutory Maternity Leave if:\n\n  * you\u2019re an [employee not a \u2018worker\u2019](/employment-status)\n  * you give your employer the [correct notice](/maternity-pay-leave/how-to-claim)\n\n\n\nIt does not matter how long you\u2019ve been with your employer, how many hours you work or how much you get paid.\n\nYou cannot get Statutory Maternity Leave if you have a child through surrogacy - you could get [Statutory Adoption Leave and Pay](/adoption-pay-leave) instead.\n\n## Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP)\n\nTo qualify for SMP you must:\n\n  * earn on average at least \u00a3123 a week\n  * give the [correct notice and proof you\u2019re pregnant](/maternity-pay-leave/how-to-claim)\n  * have [worked for your employer continuously](/continuous-employment-what-it-is) for at least 26 weeks continuing into the \u2018qualifying week\u2019 - the 15th week before the expected week of childbirth\n\n\n\nYou cannot get SMP if you go into police custody during your maternity pay period. It will not restart when you\u2019re discharged.\n\n## Early births or you lose your baby\n\nYou can still get Statutory Maternity Leave and SMP if your baby:\n\n  * is born early\n  * is stillborn after the start of your 24th week of pregnancy\n  * dies after being born\n\n\n\n## If you\u2019re not eligible for SMP\n\nYour employer must give you form SMP1 explaining why you cannot get SMP within 7 days of making their decision. You may be eligible for [Maternity Allowance](/maternity-allowance) instead.\n\n[Download form SMP1 - \u2018Statutory Maternity Pay\u2019](/government/publications/statutory-maternity-pay-employee-not-entitled-form-for-employers)\n\n## How to claim \n\n## Statutory Maternity Leave\n\nAt least 15 weeks before your due date, tell your employer when the baby is due and when you want to start your maternity leave. Your employer can ask for this in writing.\n\nYour employer must write to you within 28 days confirming your start and end dates.\n\nUse the [maternity planner](/pay-leave-for-parents) to work out when you must claim your maternity leave.\n\n## Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP)\n\nTell your employer you want to stop work to have a baby and the day you want your SMP to start. You must give them at least 28 days\u2019 notice (in writing if they ask for it) and proof that you\u2019re pregnant.\n\nYour employer must confirm within 28 days how much SMP you\u2019ll get and when it will start and stop.\n\nIf they decide you\u2019re not eligible, they must give you form SMP1 within 7 days of making their decision and explain why.\n\n## Proof you\u2019re pregnant\n\nYou need to give your employer proof of the pregnancy to get SMP. You do not need it for maternity leave.\n\nWithin 21 days of your SMP start date (or as soon as possible if the baby\u2019s born early) give your employer either:\n\n  * a letter from your doctor or midwife\n  * your MATB1 certificate - doctors and midwives will give you this no more than 20 weeks before the due date\n\n\n\nYou will not get SMP if you do not give your employer proof that the baby is due.\n\n## Extra help \n\n## Maternity benefits\n\nUse a [benefits calculator](/benefits-calculators) to see what help you can get from:\n\n  * Universal Credit\n  * Child Benefit\n  * Child Tax Credit\n  * Working Tax Credit - this can continue for 39 weeks after you go on maternity leave\n  * Income Support - you may get this while you\u2019re not working\n\n\n\nYou could get a \u00a3500 [Sure Start Maternity Grant](/sure-start-maternity-grant) (usually if it\u2019s your first child).\n\nIf you\u2019re not eligible for Statutory Maternity Pay, you could get [Maternity Allowance](/maternity-allowance) from the government.\n\n## Company maternity schemes\n\nYou might get more than the statutory amount of leave and pay if your employer has a company maternity scheme. They cannot offer you less than the statutory amount.\n\n## Extra leave\n\nYou could get 18 weeks\u2019 [unpaid parental leave](/parental-leave) after the birth - this may be restricted to 4 weeks per year.\n  *[SMP]: Statutory Maternity Pay",

Also, there's Statutory Maternity Pay, which kinda helps with the money situation. Oh, and you can also get some paid time off for antenatal stuff, which is like doctors' appointments and all. Don\u2019t forget about some extra help from the government too if you need it! \n\nYou should probably check what kind of maternity pay and leave you can get\u2014it's all online. They even have a Welsh version if you're into that. There are some rules on when to claim all of this, or if you wanna switch your dates around or whatever, lol. \n\nOkay, so when you\u2019re on leave, you're still protected with your job, which is great because it means you\u2019ll still get pay raises and can save up vacation days and you can come back to work afterwards. \n\nStatutory Maternity Leave is a whole year (that\u2019s 52 weeks!). It's split into two parts: the first 26 weeks is called Ordinary Maternity Leave, and then there\u2019s Additional Maternity Leave for the next 26. You don\u2019t HAVE to take all of it, but you gotta take at least 2 weeks off after you pop\u20144 weeks if you\u2019re working in a factory, whatever that means! You can play around with a maternity planner online to figure that stuff out, it's all there. \n\nNow about when you can start your leave\u2014usually you can kick it off about 11 weeks before your baby\u2019s due date, but if your little one decides to come early, like surprise! your leave starts the day after they arrive. If you\u2019re sick because of the pregnancy in the last month before your due date, it kicks in automatically too. So that\u2019s something! \n\nIf you wanna change when you\u2019re coming back to work, just let your boss know like, 8 weeks ahead of time or something. \n\nNow let\u2019s talk pay! Statutory Maternity Pay (or SMP for short) is good for about 39 weeks. You get like 90% of what you usually earn (before taxes) for the first six weeks, which is pretty sweet. After that, it's either \u00a3184.03 a week, or again, 90% of what you usually make\u2014whichever is cheaper. They pay you this same way you\u2019re getting your salary, so monthly or weekly, but they'll take taxes and National Insurance stuff out as well. You can figure out your SMP amount with their handy online calculator, or whatever. \n\nIt usually starts when you start your maternity leave unless you\u2019ve been off work sick due to pregnancy problems close to your due date. Then it kicks in too. \n\nGot problems with how much you're supposed to be getting? Ask your boss to explain it to you. If they can't pay you or if there's some like disagreement, you might need to hit up the Statutory Payment Disputes Team for help. \n\nTo get Statutory Maternity Leave, you gotta be officially an employee and not just like a worker bee or something. You gotta also give your employer the right heads up about when your due date is. It doesn\u2019t really matter how long you've been with your company or how many hours you work, as long as you're qualifying. \n\nAnd for SMP, you need to make at least \u00a3123 a week and you gotta prove you're preggy and worked for your employer for 26 weeks into the 'qualification week,' which is like, the 15th week before your expected birth week. \n\nIf your baby ends up arriving too soon, or if things go south like stillbirth after your 24th week of pregnancy, you\u2019re still good for maternity leave and pay, which is nice. \n\nIf your boss says you can\u2019t get SMP for some reason, they gotta give you this form called SMP1 which tells you why\u2014and they do it within 7 days, or they should. \n\nSo, like, at least 15 weeks before baby day, tell your boss when the baby\u2019s coming and when you wanna start your leave. They gotta get back to you within 28 days to confirm your start and end dates, right? You got this maternity planner online to help figure it out too. \n\nWhen you're ready to apply for SMP, just tell your employer that you're off for baby-related stuff, and when you want SMP to kick in. They need at least 28 days\u2019 notice, and they might want proof you're pregnant on top of that. \n\nYou need some sort of proof of pregnancy too, to get SMP; like a letter from your doctor or this MATB1 form that docs and midwives give out around 20 weeks before your due date\u2014just remember to give that to your employer fast, like within 21 days after your SMP starts or if the baby shows up early or whatever. Otherwise, you won\u2019t get your pay.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget about possible extra help you might score when you have a baby, like cash from the government through benefits! Universal Credit, Child Benefit, and Child Tax Credit might be things to check out for extra bucks. \n\nIf your job has a cool maternity scheme, you might even get more than the standard leave and pay, which is super nice. Plus, after the baby, you could also get some unpaid parental leave\u2014up to 18 weeks, but they might only allow 4 weeks per year, so keep that in mind!",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, like, if you're taking a break from work \u2018cause your partner's having a baby, adopting, or going through surrogacy stuff, you might get some benefits, right? Here\u2019s a quick rundown:\n\n- You could snag 1 or 2 weeks of paid Paternity Leave.\n- Paternity Pay could be in your future, too.\n- Oh, and don\u2019t forget about Shared Parental Leave and Pay if you want to share the baby duties.\n\nAnd, oh yeah, there's a Welsh version of this guide, which is neat, I guess?\n\nNow, while you\u2019re on paternity leave, your job rights are still like, totally safe, which means you still get raises, keep accruing holiday days, and you can come back to work after. So that\u2019s cool. You also can take time off to go with your partner (or the surrogate) to two prenatal appointments. And if you\u2019re adopting, same deal, just two adoption appointments after you get matched up with a kid.\n\n### Leave Time\n\nAs for the leave time, it kinda depends on when the baby is due, so here we go:\n\n#### If the baby\u2019s due before or on April 6, 2024\nYou can either take 1 or 2 weeks off, but you gotta take it all at once. Doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re having twins, you still just get that one week or two. Also, a week equals however many days you usually work, which is super simple. Like, if you work Mondays and Tuesdays, then one week means two days. Easy, right?\n\nYour leave can\u2019t kick off before the baby arrives, but it gotta wrap up within 56 days after the birth. Also, you should let your boss know at least 28 days ahead if you wanna switch when you\u2019re taking off.\n\n#### If the baby\u2019s due after April 6, 2024\nFor this, same 1 or 2 weeks thing, but now you can take them separately if you want. Just remember, no leave can start before the baby shows up, and it has to end within 52 weeks after. 28 days notice still applies if you want to change anything.\n\n### Shared Parental Leave\n\nAnd if you wanna split the leave with your partner, you might look into Shared Parental Leave, but just a heads up, once you take Paternity leave, you can\u2019t take SPL. Makes sense, right? \n\n### Time for Appointments\n\nYou can take unpaid leave to go with the expectant mom to two appointments if you\u2019re:\n- The dad\n- The mom's partner or spouse\n- In a long-term relationship with her\n- The intended parent in surrogacy situations\n\nYou get, like, 6 and a half hours per appointment, unless your boss says otherwise.\n\n#### Adoption Appointments\n\nSame rules kinda apply here for adopting. You can take unpaid leave to go to two meetings, but again, you get those 6 and a half hours too. And just like that, you can apply for leave if you're a permanent staff member. If you work for an agency, you gotta put in at least 12 weeks to be eligible.\n\n### Money Matters\n\nPaternity Pay comes out to about \u00a3184.03 or 90% of what you usually earn - whichever is lower. They\u2019ll pay you like they do your salary, so tax and stuff is still taken out.\n\n### Leave Duration\n\nSo when you\u2019re on leave, they\u2019ll usually pay you during that time, and you gotta give your employer a heads up of 28 days if you wanna change when the pay starts, okay?\n\n### Who Can Take Leave?\n\nIf you want to get some paternity leave or pay, you gotta be:\n- The dad\n- The mom\u2019s partner\n- The child\u2019s adopter\n- The intended parent through surrogacy\n\nThere are different rules if you live in Northern Ireland, so keep that in mind!\n\n### If Things Don\u2019t Go Well\n\nIf things tragically go south and you lose your baby, you can still qualify for leave or pay if it\u2019s stillborn after 24 weeks or if the baby\u2019s born alive at any point. You could still take any leave you had before \u2013 like that won\u2019t go away.\n\n### How to Claim\n\nYou gotta ask your employer for Paternity Leave and Pay and let them know at least 15 weeks ahead of time. Fill out an online form or whatever they have, but remember, no need to prove pregnancy or anything.\n\nAnd that\u2019s basically it! A lot of rules, but there you go. Just makes it easier to know everyone's waiting for your little one!",

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so like, when you take time off 'cuz you're adopting a kid or using a surrogate, you might be able to get some stuff like Statutory Adoption Leave and Statutory Adoption Pay. You gotta check the rules on when and how to claim all that paid leave stuff too, and if you wanna change your dates or whatever. Oh, and there's also this Shared Parental Leave you might be able to take if you\u2019re eligible. \n\nSo you got your job rights while you're on leave, which is cool. Like, you still get pay raises, your holiday time builds up, and you can come back to work when your leave is over. \n\nNow, Statutory Adoption Leave is a whole year long (52 weeks), which is split into 26 weeks of Ordinary Adoption Leave and then another 26 weeks of Additional Adoption Leave. But keep in mind, only one person in the couple can take this leave, so the other partner might take paternity leave instead.\n\nWhen you take leave, you can also get some time off to go to like 5 adoption appointments after you match with the kid, which is nice. You can use this planner deal to figure out your dates. \n\nYour leave can start either 14 days before the kid's supposed to start living with you if it\u2019s in the UK, or when the kid gets to the UK if it's an overseas adoption, or even on the day the kid is born or day after if it\u2019s through a surrogate. You gotta tell your boss if your dates change within 28 days, and if you wanna change when you're coming back, you need to give 8 weeks heads-up. \n\nStatutory Adoption Pay is like for up to 39 weeks where you get paid like this: 90% of what you usually earn for the first 6 weeks and then it drops to like \u00a3184 or 90% of your earnings for the next 33 weeks. It gets paid the same way as your regular wages, and tax and National Insurance stuff comes out of it, obviously.\n\nSo if your boss has a better adoption pay plan, you might get more than the minimum they have to give you. Just note that Statutory Adoption Pay starts when you start your adoption leave. \n\nIf there\u2019s any issues with your pay or if your employer can\u2019t pay you, like if they go bankrupt or something, you've gotta get in touch with the Statutory Payment Disputes Team. \n\nUh, for eligibility stuff, you've gotta be an employee to get Statutory Adoption Leave and give proper notice and proof of adoption if they ask for it. If you're going for an overseas adoption, you also have to sign this form SC6 if you\u2019re with a partner. \n\nOkay, to get the pay, you need to have been employed with your company for at least 26 weeks before you matched with the child and have to earn at least \u00a3123 a week on average before tax. And you have to give notice and proof again.\n\nFor overseas adoptions, just the same rules apply. Same if you\u2019re using a surrogate, but you gotta have been employed for 26 weeks by the 15th week before the baby comes. You also gotta wanna apply for a parental order and expect to get it. If you\u2019re related to the child genetically, like if you\u2019re a donor, you can pick paternity leave, can't do both though.\n\nIf you're fostering for adoption and are eligible, you can start getting that pay and leave once the kid comes to live with you.\n\nBut you can't get Statutory Adoption Leave if you go through private adoption or become a special guardian or if it's like adopting a stepchild or family member, just to be clear. \n\nIf you're not eligible, your employer has to give you this SAP1 form explaining why you don\u2019t qualify. But you could get help from your local council if you are adopting.\n\nFor claiming the stuff, it\u2019s a little different if you\u2019re adopting from abroad or using a surrogate. You need to tell your employer within 7 days of matching that you wanna take leave, when you want to start, and the placement date. They can ask for it in writing and proof. They should confirm your dates within 28 days, so you can use that planner thing too. \n\nFor the pay stuff, just tell your boss you want to stop working to adopt and when you want your pay to start, giving them 28 days notice and proof again. They'll tell you within 28 days how much you'll get and when it starts and stops. If they decide you don't qualify, they gotta give you the SAP1 form within 7 days explaining their decision. \n\nYou need to give proof of the adoption to get the Statutory Adoption Pay, but not really for the leave unless they ask. This proof should have your name, the agency\u2019s info, match date, and placement date, and for overseas, that notification from UK authority too.\n\nFor overseas adoptions, tell your employer dates for things like the notification and the actual arrival, plus leave dates with 28 days notice.\n\nAnd for surrogates, give your employer the due date and when you wanna start your leave at least 15 weeks beforehand, and they may wanna see it in writing. You might also need a legal statement to confirm you'll apply for a parental order! It\u2019s like a lot of details but you got this!",

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so like, here\u2019s the deal with the Widowed Parent\u2019s Allowance (WPA), but now it\u2019s actually this new thing called Bereavement Support Payment. So, if you\u2019re already getting the WPA, don\u2019t worry! You\u2019ll keep getting it until you\u2019re not eligible anymore. By the way, there's this whole Welsh version you can check out, if you speak that. \n\nSo, you can only apply for WPA if your partner kicked the bucket before April 6, 2017. When they died, you guys musta either been married or like, living together all couple-like. If you were hitched or in a civil partnership, your partner has to have just recently passed away too, and you gotta figure out how they died, like, maybe from sickness or something.\n\nOther stuff to remember: \n- You gotta be under State Pension age (you can check that on a website, just Google it). \n- Your partner should\u2019ve paid National Insurance, unless they died from a work accident or some illness that happened because of work.\n- Also, you gotta be getting Child Benefit for at least one kid.\n\nOh, and you might be able to get WPA if you were pregnant when your partner died or if you had fertility stuff going on.\n\nBut hey, don\u2019t apply for WPA if: \n- You got divorced or your partnership ended when your partner passed. \n- You weren\u2019t living with them when they died. \n- You\u2019ve started up a new marriage or civil partnership. \n- You\u2019re living with someone else like you\u2019re a couple. \n- You\u2019re over State Pension age when they died. \n- Or, ya know, if you\u2019re in jail. \n\nNow, about what you\u2019ll get \u2013 it\u2019s based on how much your partner paid in those National Insurance contributions. The most you can get is like, \u00a3148.40 a week. If your partner died from a work-related accident or disease, you can still get WPA even if they didn\u2019t pay in. \n\nYou keep getting the WPA until you:\n1. Stop getting Child Benefit, or \n2. Hit State Pension age, which is like that age that everyone talks about but you should probably look it up.\n\nPayments usually go straight into your bank or credit union, easy peasy. \n\nAlso, any other benefits you get might change when you start this WPA, so you gotta tell \u2018em right away if you\u2019re getting like, Income Support or any of those things I mentioned, so you don\u2019t end up owing money or getting fined or whatever. \n\nThen there\u2019s this benefit cap, which is like a limit on how much benefits you can get in total. It's something to think about if you\u2019re over 16 but not retired yet, and some benefits don\u2019t count toward it, but it can mess with your total.\n\nWanna claim? If you\u2019re in England, Scotland, or Wales, do this:\n- Fill out a form BB1 if you were married.\n- Or fill a BB2 if you were just living like a couple. \n\nSend that off to Dover Benefit Centre, which sounds fancy, but it\u2019s just like a PO box in Wolverhampton.\n\nIf you\u2019re in Northern Ireland, call their Bereavement Service, and you can also download the form there. If you\u2019re living abroad, contact the International Pension Centre to see if you can still apply from wherever. \n\nYou gotta include your name, birthday, and National Insurance number if you got that info.\n\nIf you disagree with a decision they make, you can ask for \u2018mandatory reconsideration,\u2019 which sounds pretty serious. \n\nAnd if anything changes, like you stop getting Child Benefit or remarry or something, you gotta tell them immediately.  \n\nOh, and if you\u2019ve been overpaid, that\u2019s a no-go, you\u2019ll need to pay it back if you didn\u2019t notify them about changes quick enough or if there\u2019s been some mistake. \n\nSo yeah, that\u2019s pretty much it! Make sure you keep track of everything because it can get a bit messy! Good luck!",

If you already receive WPA, your payments will continue until you are no longer eligible. You can only make a new claim for WPA if your partner died before 6 April 2017. When they died, you and your partner must have either been married, in a civil partnership, or living together as though you were married or in a civil partnership.",
            "badly_written_snippet": "The Widowed Parent\u2019s Allowance (WPA) \u2013 which is like a financial thingy, you know? \u2013 has been switched out for this thing called Bereavement Support Payment and if you're one of those lucky folks getting WPA, well, good for you, your cash flow will just keep on flowing until you hit the eligibility wall! Now, listen up, if your significant other departed before that infamous date of 6 April 2017, THEN and ONLY THEN can you go about making a new claim for WPA because you had better be married, or in one of those civil partnerships, or playing house like you mean it!

            "badly_written_snippet": "Okay, so let's break it down. If, and only if, you\u2019re under that magical age known as State Pension age, and your dearly departed partner just so happened to contribute to those National Insurance dues, or maybe they kicked the bucket due to some work mishap, then bingo! You might be in the running for WPA! And like, if you're also getting Child Benefit for one of your offspring, that could help too! Plus, if you had a bun in the oven when your partner bit the dust, or if there was any fertility wizardry involved, which, by the way, can get a little, um, complicated, you might still be good to go!

            "badly_written_snippet": "So, like, let\u2019s talk about the stuff you CANNOT do. If you got a divorce or ended that civil union right before your partner checked out, then don\u2019t even THINK about claiming WPA! And if you weren't hitching your wagon together at the time of their demise \u2013 well then, unless there's some kind of secret loophole we don\u2019t know about, you might be out of luck there too! Oh, and did I mention if you\u2019ve tied the knot again or are shacking up with someone new, that's also a big NO-NO! Seriously, don\u2019t even try if you're living it up past that State Pension age either or if, you know, you happen to be enjoying the, um, leisure activities that come with being behind bars! What are you even doing\u2026?"

            "badly_written_snippet": "Now, when it comes to the cold hard cash from WPA, it totally depends on how much your partner funneled into the National Insurance pot! The max you can snag is \u00a3148.40 per week, which, you know, isn\u2019t exactly going to make you rich, am I right? But here's the kicker, if your partner pulled that dramatic exit due to, like, a work incident, it doesn\u2019t even matter if they contributed to National Insurance\u2014like, WHAT? Isn\u2019t it totally absurd how the system works?!"

            "badly_written_snippet": "So, here\u2019s the scoop: usually your Widowed Parent\u2019s Allowance cash gets dumped straight into whatever bank account or building society you have \u2013 super convenient, right? But like, hold up! If you've got any other cash inflows happening or if your financial situation changes, you HAVE to shout it out because otherwise, the powers that be might go ahead and mess up your dosh!

Send it all off to Dover Benefit Centre, because apparently that\u2019s where all the magic happens! If you happen to be living in Northern Ireland, just pick up the phone and call the Bereavement Service \u2013 no big deal! And all you globe trotters out there? Yep, you gotta ring up the International Pension Centre to figure out if you're still eligible, which could be a total headache, am I right? Good luck with all that!"

      "body": "## Overview \n\nEmployees may be able to get Shared Parental Leave (SPL) and Statutory Shared Parental Pay (ShPP) if they\u2019ve had a baby or adopted a child.\n\nThis guide is also available [in Welsh (Cymraeg)](/absenoldeb-a-thal-ar-y-cyd-i-rieni-canllaw-i-gyflogwyr).\n\nEmployees can [start SPL](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay-employer-guide/starting-shared-parental-leave) if [they\u2019re eligible](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay-employer-guide/eligibility) and they or their partner end their maternity or adoption leave or pay early. The remaining leave will be available as SPL. The remaining pay may be available as ShPP.\n\nEmployees can take SPL in up to 3 separate [blocks of leave](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay-employer-guide/blocks-of-leave). They can also share the leave with their partner if they\u2019re also eligible. Parents can choose how much of the SPL each of them will take.\n\nExample\n\nA mother and her partner are both eligible for SPL and ShPP. The mother ends her maternity leave and pay after 12 weeks, leaving 40 weeks available for SPL and 27 weeks available for ShPP. The parents can choose how to split this.\n\nSPL and ShPP must be taken between the baby\u2019s birth and first birthday (or within 1 year of adoption).\n\nSPL and ShPP are only available in England, Scotland and Wales.\n\n## Eligibility \n\nSometimes only one parent in a couple will be eligible to get Shared Parental Leave (SPL) and Statutory Shared Parental Pay (ShPP). This means that they cannot share the leave.\n\nIf your employee is eligible then they can use SPL to book their leave in [separate blocks](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay-employer-guide/blocks-of-leave).\n\n## Shared Parental Leave\n\nTo qualify for SPL, your employee must share responsibility for the child with one of the following:\n\n  * their husband, wife, civil partner or joint adopter\n  * the child\u2019s other parent\n  * their partner (if they live with them)\n\n\n\nYour employee or their partner must be eligible for [maternity pay or leave](/maternity-pay-leave/eligibility), [adoption pay or leave](/adoption-pay-leave/eligibility) or [Maternity Allowance](/maternity-allowance/eligibility).\n\nThey must also:\n\n  * still be employed by you while they take SPL\n  * give you the [correct notice](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay-employer-guide/starting-shared-parental-leave) including a declaration that their partner meets the employment and income requirements which allow your employee to get SPL\n  * have been [continuously employed by you](/continuous-employment-what-it-is) for at least 26 weeks up to any day of the \u2018qualifying week\u2019, or the week they are matched with a child for adoption in the UK\n\n\n\nThe \u2018qualifying week\u2019 is the 15th week before the baby is due.\n\n## Statutory Shared Parental Pay\n\nThey can get ShPP if they\u2019re [an employee](/employment-status/employee) and one of the following applies:\n\n  * they\u2019re eligible for [Statutory Maternity Pay](/employers-maternity-pay-leave) (SMP) or [Statutory Adoption Pay](/adoption-pay-leave/eligibility) (SAP)\n  * they\u2019re eligible for [Statutory Paternity Pay](/paternity-pay-leave/eligibility) (SPP) and their partner is eligible for SMP, [Maternity Allowance](/maternity-allowance/eligibility) (MA) or SAP\n\n\n\nThey can also get ShPP if they\u2019re [a worker](/employment-status/worker) and they\u2019re eligible for SMP or SPP.\n\n## Refusing SPL or ShPP\n\nYou can refuse SPL or ShPP if the employee does not qualify.\n\nYou must tell the employee the reason if you refuse ShPP. You do not have to give a reason for refusing SPL.\n\n## Entitlement \n\nIf an [employee is eligible](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay-employer-guide/eligibility) and they or their partner end maternity or adoption leave and pay (or Maternity Allowance) early, then they can:\n\n  * take the rest of the 52 weeks of leave (up to a maximum of 50 weeks) as Shared Parental Leave (SPL)\n  * take the rest of the 39 weeks of pay (up to a maximum of 37 weeks) as Statutory Shared Parental Pay (ShPP)\n\n\n\nA mother must take a minimum of 2 weeks\u2019 maternity leave following the birth (4 if she works in a factory).\n\nShPP is paid at the rate of \u00a3184.03 a week or 90% of an employee\u2019s average weekly earnings, whichever is lower.\n\n## Extra leave or pay\n\nYou can offer more than the statutory amounts if you have a company scheme for shared parental leave and pay. You must make sure your scheme\u2019s policies are clear and available to staff.\n\n## Reclaiming payments\n\nEven if you pay an employee more than the statutory amount, you can usually only reclaim 92% of that amount. You may be able to reclaim 103% if you qualify for Small Employers\u2019 Relief. Read more about [reclaiming statutory pay](/recover-statutory-payments).\n\n## Starting Shared Parental Leave \n\nFor Shared Parental Leave (SPL) to start, the mother or adopter must do one of the following:\n\n  * end their maternity or adoption leave by returning to work\n  * give you \u2018binding notice\u2019 (a decision that cannot normally be changed) of the date when they\u2019ll end their maternity or adoption leave\n  * end maternity pay or Maternity Allowance (if they\u2019re not entitled to maternity leave, for example they\u2019re an agency worker or self-employed)\n\n\n\nA mother must take a minimum of 2 weeks\u2019 maternity leave following the birth (4 if she works in a factory).\n\nThe adoptive parent getting Statutory Adoption Pay must take at least 2 weeks\u2019 adoption leave. They can take it from the day of the placement, or up to 14 days before the placement starts.\n\nThe mother must give you notice (at least 8 weeks) to end her maternity pay, or tell Jobcentre Plus to end her Maternity Allowance. Adopters must give you notice to end adoption pay.\n\nSPL can start for the partner while the mother or adopter is still on maternity or adoption leave if she\u2019s given binding notice to end her leave (or pay if she\u2019s not entitled to leave).\n\nExample\n\nA mother and her partner are both eligible for SPL.\n\nThe mother goes on maternity leave 10 weeks before her baby is born. She decides that she\u2019ll take 16 weeks of maternity leave and gives you notice.\n\nSince the mother has given binding notice, her partner can start SPL as soon as the baby has been born (as long as they\u2019ve given at least 8 weeks\u2019 notice).\n\n## What the employee must do\n\nThe employee must give you written notice if they want to start SPL or Statutory Shared Parental Pay (ShPP). They can do this using [forms created by the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas)](https://www.acas.org.uk/shared-parental-leave-form-templates).\n\nAfter receiving this notice, you can ask for:\n\n  * a copy of the child\u2019s birth certificate\n  * the name and address of their partner\u2019s employer\n\n\n\nYou have 14 days to ask for this information. Your employee then has a further 14 days to provide it.\n\n## Notice period\n\nAn employee must give at least 8 weeks\u2019 notice of any leave they wish to take. If the child is born more than 8 weeks early, this notice period can be shorter.\n\nYour employee has a statutory right to a maximum of 3 separate [blocks of leave](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay-employer-guide/blocks-of-leave), although you can allow more if you wish.\n\n## Cancelling the decision to end maternity or adoption leave\n\nThe mother or adopter may be able to change their decision to end maternity or adoption leave early if both:\n\n  * the planned end date has not passed\n  * they have not already returned to work\n\n\n\nOne of the following must also apply:\n\n  * it\u2019s discovered during the 8-week notice period that neither partner is eligible for either SPL or ShPP\n  * the employee\u2019s partner has died\n  * it\u2019s less than 6 weeks after the birth (and the mother gave notice before the birth)\n\n\n\n## Shared parental leave in touch (SPLIT) days\n\nYour employee can work up to 20 days during SPL without bringing it to an end. These are called \u2018shared parental leave in touch\u2019 (or SPLIT) days.\n\nThese days are in addition to the 10 \u2018keeping in touch\u2019 (or KIT) days already available to those on maternity or adoption leave.\n\nKeeping in touch days are optional - both you and your employee must agree to them.\n\n## Blocks of leave \n\nAn employee taking Shared Parental Leave (SPL) can split their leave into up to 3 separate blocks instead of taking it all in one go, even if they are not sharing the leave with their partner.\n\nIf both parents are taking SPL then they can take their leave at the same time as each other or at different times.\n\nThe employee must give you at least 8 weeks\u2019 notice before a block of leave begins.\n\n## Splitting blocks\n\nIf you agree, the employee can split a block of leave into shorter periods of at least a week. For example they could work every other week during a 12-week block, using a total of 6 weeks of their SPL.\n\nYou cannot turn down a request for a block of leave if the employee is eligible and gives you the right notice. You do not have to agree to the employee breaking the block of leave into shorter periods.\n\n## Record keeping \n\nYou must keep records for HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), including:\n\n  * the evidence provided by the employee to show that they\u2019re eligible for ShPP\n  * the date ShPP began\n  * your ShPP payments (including dates)\n  * the ShPP you\u2019ve reclaimed\n  * any weeks you did not pay and why\n\n\n\nYou must keep records for at least 3 years from the end of the tax year they relate to.\n\n## Help with statutory pay \n\nFor [financial help with statutory pay](/recover-statutory-payments), you can:\n\n  * reclaim payments (usually 92%)\n  * apply for an advance if you cannot afford payments\n\n\n  *[SPL]: Shared Parental Leave\n  *[ShPP]: Shared Parental Pay\n  *[SMP]: Statutory Maternity Pay\n  *[SAP]: Statutory Adoption Pay\n  *[SPP]: Statutory Paternity Pay\n  *[MA]: Maternity Allowance\n  *[Acas]: Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service\n  *[SPLIT]: Shared parental leave in touch\n  *[KIT]: Keeping in touch\n  *[HMRC]: HM Revenue and Customs",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, let\u2019s talk about this Shared Parental Leave (or SPL, pretty sure that\u2019s what it is) and Statutory Shared Parental Pay like ShPP or something, which I guess you can get if you have a kid or, like, adopt one. Pretty straightforward, right? Oh, and there\u2019s this Welsh version too, if that\u2019s your thing\u2014just so you know. \n\nEmployees can kick off their SPL if they meet some criteria, (no clue what all that entails, but they probably have to give a heads up or something). Basically, if the peeps have been on maternity leave or whatever, they can take some more shared time off. And yeah, they can take this leave in, like, three different chunks or blocks. So they can like share it with their partner if that partner is also eligible. Just picture it, parental leave for 40 weeks and the parents get to divvy it up. Like, who gets what? You know what I mean? \n\nFor instance, there\u2019s this couple, right? Like, the mom\u2019s taking a break for twelve weeks and then boom, they can split the leave after that. Simple enough, I guess. \n\nBut, there\u2019s like deadlines too! They gotta use this SPL and ShPP stuff between baby\u2019s birth day and their first birthday, or if they adopt, then within a year of that. And this is just for England, Scotland, and Wales, so if you\u2019re in, like, Northern Ireland, sorry, not for you. \n\nSometimes, one parent won\u2019t qualify for SPL or ShPP. If you\u2019re an employee though, you can book your leave in separate blocks if you are eligible. But you gotta be sharing the responsibility with some other folks, like a partner or spouse or maybe a civil partner. So, if you\u2019re a lone wolf\u2026 well, you might be outta luck.\n\nFor SPL, they have to be counting on someone like their partner or spouse. And oh, they must've been working at the company for at least 26 weeks before whatever the 'qualifying week' is, which happens to be this mysterious 15th week before the baby drops. Sounds super complicated, haha. \n\nAbout this Statutory Shared Parental Pay gig, it kicks in if the employee is doing OK with their employment status\u2014either like an actual employee or, I don\u2019t know, a worker. They need to be covered under either maternity pay or something. If things match up, they can start pulling in that cash, which is like, \u00a3184.03 a week, or 90% of what they used to earn or something like that. So you gotta keep a close watch on the deadlines and all. \n\nYou can totally refuse SPL or ShPP if they messed up their eligibility stuff. But you only gotta give a reason behind refusing ShPP, but nah, not SPL. \n\nIf both parents do the whole end-maternity thing early, like, bam! They can stretch that out into 50 weeks of leave, probably maxing out at 37 weeks of pay as ShPP. There's this minimum too, which is 2 weeks after the baby is born, cause, like, that\u2019s the law or whatever and I think it\u2019s longer if you\u2019re factory working.\n\nNow, if your company has a better deal than the legal minimum, sure, go ahead, but make sure folks know about it. And if you\u2019re paying more than the bare minimum, you might be able to get some of that back, but probably about 92% or maybe even 103% if you\u2019re lucky. Just check out whatever rules apply. \n\nTo kick off this SPL, the mom or the adoptive parent has to do stuff like going back to work or giving you some kind of heads up on when they want to stop the maternity leave. Oh, and I think they can give at least 8 weeks\u2019 notice or something like that. There\u2019s tons of paperwork involved which sounds like a drag but whatever.\n\nEmployees can work like 20 days during this SPL gig without messing it up. They call it these SPLIT days, which is cool, cause who doesn\u2019t want to keep in touch while on leave? You gotta agree on this (surprise, surprise) but it's pretty neat, I guess, if both parties are on board. \n\nAlso, uh, just to let you know, employees can break their leave into up to 3 separate chunks, which is nice if one big chunk seems too hefty. They gotta give you that notice so you know when to expect them to be off. \n\nRemember to keep track of all this stuff\u2014HMRC wants to see your records about what\u2019s happening with their leave and pay, so don\u2019t forget to write it down! You\u2019ll want to keep that sorted for like, a few years. \n\nSo if you\u2019re stuck on how to get more help or whatever with everything going on, you might want to check local advice groups or the official resources. And uh, that\u2019s about it, I think! Hope that helps, or not, haha! Good luck juggling all this parenting stuff!",

You can also choose to be off work together or to stagger the leave and pay.\n\nTo get SPL and ShPP, you and your partner need to:\n\n  * meet the eligibility criteria - there\u2019s different [criteria for birth parents](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay/eligibility-for-birth-parents) and [criteria for adoptive parents or parents using a surrogate](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay/eligibility-for-adopters)\n\n  * [give notice to your employers](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay/applying-for-leave-and-pay)\n\n  * give up some of your maternity or adoption leave and pay\n\n\n\n\n## Giving up maternity and adoption leave and pay\n\nTo get SPL and ShPP you or your partner has to:\n\n  * take less than the 52 weeks of maternity or adoption leave and use the rest as SPL\n  * take less than the 39 weeks of maternity or adoption pay (or Maternity Allowance) and use the rest as ShPP\n\n\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re the mother and you\u2019ve taken 22 weeks of Maternity Leave and Statutory Maternity Pay, you can share 30 weeks of SPL and 17 weeks of ShPP with your partner.\n\n## Eligibility for birth parents \n\nTo be eligible for Shared Parental Leave (SPL) and Statutory Shared Parental Pay (ShPP), both parents must:\n\n  * share responsibility for the child at birth\n  * meet work and pay criteria - these are different depending on which parent wants to use the shared parental leave and pay\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re not eligible if you started sharing responsibility for the child after it was born.\n\nThe eligibility criteria are different [if you\u2019re adoptive parents or parents using a surrogate](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay/eligibility-for-adopters).\n\nYou can [check if you can get SPL and ShPP](https://www.check-shared-parental-leave.service.gov.uk/). You\u2019ll need to know:\n\n  * your child\u2019s due date or birth date\n  * your and your partner\u2019s [employment status](/employment-status) and earnings\n  * if you and your partner can get [Statutory Maternity Pay](/maternity-pay-leave/eligibility) or [Statutory Paternity Pay](/paternity-pay-leave/eligibility)\n\n\n\n## If both parents want to share the SPL and ShPP\n\nBoth parents must meet the same eligibility criteria to get SPL and ShPP. You must:\n\n  * have been employed continuously by the same employer for at least 26 weeks by the end of the 15th week before the due date\n  * stay with the same employer until you start your SPL\n\n\n\nTo be eligible for SPL, you must be \u2018employees\u2019 (not \u2018workers\u2019) - check your [employment status](/employment-status). If either of you is a \u2018worker\u2019, you might be able to share ShPP but not SPL.\n\nTo be eligible for ShPP, you must each earn on average at least \u00a3123 a week. If you usually earn an average of \u00a3123 or more a week each, and you only earned less in some weeks because you were on furlough under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS), you may still be eligible.\n\n## If the mother\u2019s partner wants to take the SPL and ShPP\n\nFor the mother\u2019s partner to take SPL and ShPP, both the mother and the mother\u2019s partner must meet some eligibility requirements.\n\nThe mother must:\n\n  * have been working for at least 26 weeks out of the 66 weeks before the week the baby\u2019s due (the 26 weeks do not need to be in a row)\n  * have earned at least \u00a3390 in total across any 13 of the 66 weeks (add up the highest paying weeks - they do not need to be in a row)\n\n\n\nThe mother\u2019s partner must:\n\n  * have been employed continuously by the same employer for at least 26 weeks by the end of the 15th week before the due date\n  * stay with the same employer until they start their SPL\n\n\n\nTo be eligible for SPL, the partner must be an \u2018employee\u2019 (not a \u2018worker\u2019) - check their [employment status](/employment-status).

The criteria are different depending on which one of you wants to use the shared parental leave and pay\n\nThe eligibility criteria are different [if you\u2019re birth parents](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay/eligibility-for-birth-parents).\n\nYou can [check if you can get SPL and ShPP](https://www.check-shared-parental-leave.service.gov.uk/). You\u2019ll need to know:\n\n  * your child\u2019s due date or birth date if you\u2019re using a surrogate, or the match date if you\u2019re adopting or fostering to adopt\n  * your and your partner\u2019s [employment status](/employment-status) and earnings\n  * if you and your partner can get [Statutory Adoption Pay](/adoption-pay-leave/eligibility) or [Statutory Paternity Pay](/paternity-pay-leave/eligibility)\n\n\n\n## If both parents want to share the SPL and ShPP\n\nBoth parents must meet the same eligibility criteria.\n\nTo be eligible for SPL and ShPP, you must stay with the same employer until you start your SPL. You must be employed continuously by them for at least 26 weeks, by either:\n\n  * the end of the week you or your partner are matched with a child if you\u2019re adopting\n  * the end of the 15th week before the due date if you\u2019re using a surrogate\n\n\n\nTo be eligible for SPL, you must be \u2018employees\u2019 (not \u2018workers\u2019) - check your [employment status](/employment-status). If either of you is a \u2018worker\u2019, you might be able to share ShPP but not SPL.\n\nTo be eligible for ShPP, you must each earn on average at least \u00a3123 a week. If you usually earn an average of \u00a3123 or more a week each, and you only earned less in some weeks because you were on furlough under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS), you may still be eligible.\n\n## If only one of the parents wants to take the SPL and ShPP\n\nBoth parents must meet some eligibility criteria.\n\n### Criteria for the parent taking SPL and ShPP\n\nThe parent who wants to take the leave and pay must stay with the same employer until they start their SPL.\n\nThey must also have been employed continuously by the same employer for at least 26 weeks, by either:\n\n  * the end of the week you or your partner are matched with a child if you\u2019re adopting\n  * the end of the 15th week before the due date if you\u2019re using a surrogate\n\n\n\nTo be eligible for SPL, they must be an \u2018employee\u2019 (not a \u2018worker\u2019) - check their [employment status](/employment-status). If they are a \u2018worker\u2019, they might be able to get ShPP but not SPL.\n\nTo be eligible for ShPP, they must earn on average at least \u00a3123 each a week. If they earned less than the amount needed because they were on furlough under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, they may still be eligible.\n\n### Criteria for the other parent\n\nThe other parent must:\n\n  * have been working for at least 26 weeks out of the 66 weeks before the week the child was placed with you (the 26 weeks do not need to be in a row)\n  * have earned at least \u00a3390 in total in 13 of the 66 weeks (add up the highest paying weeks - they do not need to be in a row)\n\n\n\nIf they earned less than the amount needed because they were on furlough under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, they may still be eligible.\n\n## What you'll get \n\nYou can share up to 50 weeks of leave and up to 37 weeks of pay between you.\n\nThe actual amount depends on how much maternity or adoption leave and pay (or Maternity Allowance) you or your partner take. If you or your partner are eligible then you can:\n\n  * take less than the 52 weeks of maternity or adoption leave and use the rest as Shared Parental Leave (SPL)\n  * take less than the 39 weeks of maternity or adoption pay (or Maternity Allowance) and use the rest as Statutory Shared Parental Pay (ShPP)\n\n\n\nYou can [check when you and your partner can take your leave and how much statutory pay you\u2019ll get](/plan-shared-parental-leave-pay) using the Shared Parental Leave and Pay planning tool.\n\n## How much pay you\u2019ll get\n\nShPP is paid at the rate of \u00a3184.03 a week or 90% of your average weekly earnings, whichever is lower.\n\nThis is the same as [Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP)](/maternity-pay-leave/pay) except that during the first 6 weeks SMP is paid at 90% of whatever you earn (with no maximum).\n\n### Example\n\nA woman decides to start her maternity leave 4 weeks before the due date and gives notice that she\u2019ll start SPL from 10 weeks after the birth (taking a total of 14 weeks maternity leave). She normally earns \u00a3200 a week.\n\nShe\u2019s paid \u00a3180 (90% of her average weekly earnings) as SMP for the first 6 weeks of maternity leave, then \u00a3184.03 a week for the next 8 weeks. Once she goes onto SPL, she\u2019s still paid \u00a3184.03 a week.\n\n## When you can start \n\nYou can only start Shared Parental Leave (SPL) or Shared Parental Pay (ShPP) once the child has been born or placed with your family for adoption.\n\nYou can [check when you and your partner can start your leave](/plan-shared-parental-leave-pay) using the Shared Parental Leave and Pay planning tool.\n\n## For SPL to start\n\nThe mother (or the person getting adoption leave) must either:\n\n  * return to work, which ends any maternity or adoption leave\n  * give their employer \u2018binding notice\u2019 of the date when they plan to end their leave (you cannot normally change the date you give in binding notice)\n\n\n\nYou can start SPL while your partner is still on maternity or adoption leave as long as they\u2019ve given binding notice to end it.\n\nYou can give binding notice and say when you plan to [take your SPL](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay/applying-for-leave-and-pay) at the same time.\n\nA mother cannot return to work before the end of the compulsory 2 weeks of maternity leave following the birth (4 weeks if they work in a factory). If you\u2019re adopting, the person claiming adoption pay must take at least 2 weeks of adoption leave.\n\n### If the mother or adopter does not get maternity or adoption leave\n\nThe mother or adopter must end any maternity pay, adoption pay or Maternity Allowance so that they or their partner can get SPL.\n\n## For ShPP to start\n\nThe mother (or the person getting adoption pay) must give their employer binding notice of the date when they plan to end any maternity or adoption pay.\n\nIf they get Maternity Allowance, they must give notice to Jobcentre Plus instead.\n\nThey cannot restart maternity pay, Maternity Allowance or adoption pay once it\u2019s ended.\n\nYou can start ShPP while your partner is still on maternity pay, adoption pay or Maternity Allowance as long as they\u2019ve given binding notice to end it.\n\nYou can give binding notice and say when you plan to [take your ShPP](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay/applying-for-leave-and-pay) at the same time.\n\n## Change the decision to end maternity or adoption leave\n\nThe mother or adopter may be able to change their decision to end maternity or adoption leave early. They must let their employer know.\n\nThey can only change the decision if both:\n\n  * the planned end date has not passed\n  * they have not already returned to work\n\n\n\nOne of the following must also apply:\n\n  * you find out during the 8-week notice period that neither of you is eligible for SPL or ShPP\n  * the mother or adopter\u2019s partner has died\n  * the mother tells their employer less than 6 weeks after the birth (and they gave their employer notice before the birth)\n\n## Booking blocks of leave \n\nYou can book up to 3 separate blocks of Shared Parental Leave (SPL) instead of taking it all in one go, even if you are not sharing the leave with your partner.\n\nIf your partner is also eligible for SPL, you can take up to 3 blocks of leave each. You can take leave at different times or both at the same time.\n\nYou can take more than 3 blocks of leave if your employer agrees.\n\nYou must tell your employer about your plans for leave when you [apply for SPL](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay/apply-for-shared-parental-leave). You can change these plans later but you must give your employer at least 8 weeks\u2019 notice before you want to begin a block of leave.\n\nYou can [check when you and your partner can take your leave](/plan-shared-parental-leave-pay) using the Shared Parental Leave and Pay planning tool.\n\n## Splitting blocks of leave\n\nIf your employer agrees, you can split blocks into shorter periods of at least a week.\n\n### Example\n\nA mother finishes her maternity leave at the end of October and takes the rest of her leave as SPL. She shares it with her partner, who\u2019s also eligible. They each take the whole of November as their first blocks of SPL. The partner then returns to work.\n\nThe mother also returns to work in December. She gives her employer notice that she\u2019ll go on leave again in February - this is her second block of SPL. Her employer agrees to a work pattern of 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off during the block.\n\n## Shared Parental Leave in touch (SPLIT) days\n\nYou and your partner can each work up to 20 days while you\u2019re taking SPL. These are called \u2018Shared Parental Leave in touch\u2019 (or SPLIT) days.\n\nThese days are in addition to the 10 [\u2018keeping in touch\u2019](/employee-rights-when-on-leave) (or KIT) days available to those on maternity or adoption leave.\n\nKIT and SPLIT days are optional - both you and your employer must agree to them.\n\n## Applying for leave and pay \n\nTo get Shared Parental Leave (SPL) or Shared Parental Pay (ShPP) you must:\n\n  * follow the rules for [starting SPL and ShPP](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay/when-you-can-start)\n  * give your employer at least 8 weeks\u2019 written notice of your leave dates\n\n\n\nYou can use [Shared Parental Leave forms and templates](https://www.acas.org.uk/shared-parental-leave-form-templates) created by Acas to:\n\n  * give your employer notice that you plan to take SPL and ShPP\n  * give your employer notice of when the mother or adopter is going to end their maternity or adoption leave, and when they\u2019ll stop getting maternity or adoption pay\n  * book your leave dates\n\n\n\nIf your employer has their own forms you can use those instead.\n\nYou can change your mind later about how much SPL or ShPP you plan to take and when you want to take it. You must give notice of any changes at least 8 weeks before the start of any leave.\n\nYou might not get SPL or ShPP if you do not include all the required information.\n\n## Giving more information\n\nYour employer can ask you for more information within 14 days of you applying for SPL or ShPP. They can ask for:\n\n  * a copy of the birth certificate\n  * a declaration of the place and date of birth (if the birth has not been registered yet)\n  * the name and address of your partner\u2019s employer or a declaration that your partner has no employer\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re adopting or fostering a child you\u2019re planning to adopt, your employer can ask for the:\n\n  * name and address of the adoption agency or local authority\n  * date you were matched with the child\n  * date the child will start to live with you\n  * name and address of your partner\u2019s employer or a declaration that your partner has no employer\n\n\n\nYou must give this information within 14 days of being asked for it.\n  *[SPL]: Shared Parental Leave\n  *[ShPP]: Statutory Shared Parental Pay\n  *[CJRS]: Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme\n  *[SMP]: Statutory Maternity Pay\n  *[SPLIT]: Shared Parental Leave in touch\n  *[KIT]: keeping in touch\n  *[Acas]: Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, like, if you and your partner are having a baby, or maybe adopting, or if you\u2019re using a surrogate, you can totally apply for something called Shared Parental Leave (SPL) and Statutory Shared Parental Pay (ShPP)! Sounds cool, huh? You can, um, share up to 50 weeks of leave and 37 weeks of pay, but you gotta do it in the first year when the kiddo is born or adopted. Easy peasy, right? \n\nYou can take the leave like in blocks, which is fun, or all at once, just do what works for you both. Just make sure to tell your bosses too. But there are some checklists you gotta go through. Both of you need to meet some rules or criteria or whatever. If you\u2019re birth parents, it\u2019s different from, like, if you\u2019re adopting or using a surrogate. You can find the stuff online if you need more info about it, trust me.\n\nOkay, so here\u2019s the deal. If you wanna get ShPP or SPL, one of you has to give up some maternity or adoption leave. Basically, if one of you takes, like, less than 52 weeks for maternity or adoption leave, then the rest can be SPL, which is super helpful! Like if the mom took 22 weeks off already, then she can share the rest with the partner. You got it? Cool. \n\nNow, the rules for the birth parents are kinda intense. You both gotta share responsibility and meet some work and payment stuff\u2014they\u2019re different for each parent. If you only get up to speed after the baby comes, you\u2019re outta luck, my friend!\n\nSo, there are a ton of eligibility rules. Like, both parents must have worked with the same employer for AT LEAST 26 weeks (not even in a row) before the due date. And if you\u2019re a \u2018worker\u2019 instead of an \u2018employee,\u2019 you might be eligible for ShPP but not SPL. Kinda a bummer, huh?\n\nFor the mom\u2019s partner to use SPL and ShPP, they also gotta meet some conditions, like working for the same company long enough and earning at least, like, \u00a3123 a week. Typical rules! And if either one was on furlough due to COVID stuff, that can help you still qualify for pay, so that\u2019s good.\n\nIf the mom wants to take the leave, her partner also needs to meet all the work criteria including being employed enough weeks before the baby comes. Oh, and if you\u2019re planning to foster or adopt, there are slightly different rules too, but hey, it\u2019s mostly the same idea of sharing responsibility and making sure you both hit the pay and work marks.\n\nAlright, so what do you actually get paid? For ShPP, it\u2019s either \u00a3184.03 a week, or 90% of your pay, whichever is less, I think. So if you\u2019re on maternity leave, the first few weeks you get paid differently, but then it levels out. Crazy, right?\n\nYou can only kick off your SPL after your kid is born or if they're living with you. The mom needs to either go back to work to clear any maternity leave or give notice about when she\u2019s ending her leave. And just so you know, the SPL doesn\u2019t mean the mom gets to just dip out early; she has to do a couple of weeks at least after giving birth, sorta mandatory.\n\nAnd once you\u2019ve told your boss that you wanna take SPL or ShPP, they might ask for all sorts of papers or info, like the baby\u2019s birth certificate or whatever. You gotta give them what they ask for in, like 14 days or so. But yeah, it can be a bit much, and you know\u2014it\u2019s always better to get all this planned out early so you don\u2019t lose out on anything.\n\nAnyways, that\u2019s basically how this whole SPL and ShPP thing goes. Reach out to your work for the deets, or check online! Hope this makes sense, and you guys can smash that parenting thing together. Good luck!",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, uh, if you've been getting certain benefits and you gotta pay for someone's funeral, there\u2019s this thing called Funeral Expenses Payment, or like, some people just call it Funeral Payment, pretty self-explanatory I guess? Anyway, this guide is even in Welsh if that's your jam.\n\n### Living in Scotland? \n\nIf you're in Scotland, you totally wanna apply for this thing called Funeral Support Payment. It's like the new version of Funeral Expenses Payment or whatever, so keep that in mind.\n\n### Money from the deceased? \n\nSo, if you\u2019re getting money from, like, the deceased's estate, you should know that the Funeral Expenses Payment gets taken out from that. The estate just means anything they owned, like money and property, but not their house or personal stuff left to a spouse or partner. Pretty important, you know?\n\n### What you can get paid for\n\nThis Funeral Expenses Payment helps with some of these costs:\n- Burial fees if you wanna stick them in the ground. \n- Cremation fees and stuff, including, like, a doctor's note.\n- Travel costs, like if you gotta go places for the funeral arrangements.\n- If you need to move the body more than 50 miles, that can be paid for too. \n- Death certificates and other important papers.\n\nOh and also, you could possibly get like \u00a31,000 for stuff like flowers or the coffin, funeral director\u2019s fees, all that jazz. But, like, just a heads up, the payment usually doesn't cover everything, so you still might be out of pocket. How much you get really depends on your situation though, like if you got insurance or if the deceased had any estate money.\n\nYou can also check the claim form notes if you wanna see in detail all the things this payment actually covers, for more info and all that.\n\n### Getting paid\n\nIf you\u2019ve already, like, paid for the funeral, they\u2019ll drop the Funeral Expenses Payment into your bank or building society account. But if you haven\u2019t paid yet, they pay it straight to the funeral director or whoever is organizing it, kinda practical right?\n\n### Are you eligible? \n\nTo get this payment, you gotta tick off a few boxes:\n- You\u2019re getting certain benefits or tax credits.\n- There\u2019s a rule about your relation to the deceased, don\u2019t ask me the details, just know there\u2019s rules.\n- You\u2019re actually planning a funeral in the UK or maybe in EEA or Switzerland.\n\n### What benefits do you need?\n\nSo, you or your partner need to be on stuff like:\n- Universal Credit (everyone\u2019s talking about it, so you probably have heard)\n- Income Support\n- Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance if it\u2019s income-based.\n- And a few others I can\u2019t list since we\u2019ll be here forever. You might even qualify if you got some Support for Mortgage Interest loan. \n\nAlso, if you\u2019ve applied for one of these benefits and you\u2019re just waiting for a decision, you can still go ahead and claim this Funeral Expenses Payment, so don't stress.\n\n### Relationship stuff \n\nYou can probably apply for this payment if:\n- You were the partner of the deceased (which is like a given) \n- You were the parent of a baby who didn\u2019t make it after 24 weeks. \n- Or you were responsible for a kid who passed away and was under 16 or under 20 if they were in school or training, which can happen. \n\nBut if a close relative, like a sibling or parent, is working or not on benefits, you might be outta luck for this payment. \n\n### If you\u2019re a close friend or relative \n\nWell, if the deceased didn\u2019t have a partner when they kicked the bucket, then you might be able to apply for it, too. Or if their partner or child\u2019s parent can\u2019t claim for some reason, like living abroad or in prison (crazy, right?).\n\n### How to actually make a claim\n\nSo, don\u2019t forget, you gotta apply within 6 months after the funeral, even if you're still waiting on some benefit decision.\n\nYou can go ahead and claim before the funeral if you have an actual invoice or signed contract. Not just a quote, gotta be the real deal! \n\nIf you\u2019re getting Universal Credit, just know it might take a while because you won\u2019t get a decision until after your next payment goes through. \n\nThere\u2019s also a whole different process if you happen to be in Northern Ireland, so keep that in mind!\n\n### Claiming tips \n\nYou can call this Bereavement Service helpline to make your claim, or just do it by post. Like, you download the claim form (SF200), fill it out and then mail it in. \n\n### Calling the helpline \n\nThey have a number you can call at 0800 151 2012, and if you speak Welsh there\u2019s a line for that too at 0800 731 0453. Oh, and there are other numbers for textphones and all that, so you can reach out even if calling isn\u2019t your thing. \n\nAn advisor can also help you find out about any other bereavement benefits you might qualify for, so it\u2019s worth a shot. \n\n### If you don\u2019t like the decision\n\nIf you think the decision about your Funeral Expenses Payment is, like, totally wrong, you can appeal to the Social Security and Child Support Tribunal. Just, like, don\u2019t take it lying down, okay?",

      "poorly_written_article": "Tax stuff and National Insurance stuff can be super confusing but here goes. So, if your partner kicks the bucket, guess what? Your income is likely gonna change. You might get more money from, like, pensions, benefits, or even an inheritance\u2014could mean more tax, or maybe less if you\u2019re earning less! Your tax allowances, which is basically income you don\u2019t pay tax on, could change too.\n\nSo, you gotta tell HMRC about certain incomes. Like, if you're getting interest from banks or building societies, letting out property, or stuff like Purchased Life Annuities. Also tell them if you have things like Widowed Parent\u2019s Allowance, foreign pensions, or other taxable incomes that they haven\u2019t taxed yet. But don\u2019t worry about reporting things like income that\u2019s already taxed through PAYE or money from private pensions or ISA income.\n\nIf you wanna tell HMRC about any income changes, you can do this stuff on your next Self Assessment tax return if you\u2019re into that, or just give them a ring.\n\nAbout tax allowances, if you pay Income Tax, you usually get this thing called a Personal Allowance\u2014it's what you don\u2019t pay tax on. If your income changes, they\u2019ll fix this automatically for you, which is great. And if you or your other half was born before April 6, 1935 (that\u2019s kinda old), you may have had this Married Couple\u2019s Allowance, which will stop after the current tax year. So, heads up!\n\nOh and if your partner was claiming Blind Person\u2019s Allowance, you might want to snag that from them for the current year\u2014just ask HMRC about it.\n\nNow, if you were married before April 1977 and you\u2019re a widow, lucky you! You could be paying less National Insurance. Maybe stick with that and check with HMRC. \n\nFor benefits, some of the benefits your partner was getting might need you to apply for them again since you need to be on top of this stuff now. You can claim things like Funeral Expenses Payment if you\u2019re low on cash, or Bereavement Support Payment if your spouse died in the last 21 months. Also, there\u2019s Widowed Parent\u2019s Allowance if your spouse died before April 2017 and you\u2019ve got kids.\n\nAnd if you gotta claim Child Benefit or tax credits, yeah, you\u2019ll need to make new claims for those if they were your partner\u2019s thing.\n\nIf you\u2019re on a tighter budget now, use a benefits calculator thingy to check if you can grab some benefits because, like, it sucks being short on cash. You could also check out Winter Fuel Payment or Cold Weather Payment if you qualify.\n\nThen there\u2019s pensions. You might be able to get more money from your partner\u2019s pension or National Insurance contributions\u2014so check that out too. If you\u2019re over State Pension age, then woohoo, you can claim extra payments from their pension! It\u2019ll be different if you hit pension age before or after April 2016, so keep that in mind and contact the Pension Service to see what\u2019s what.\n\nOh, and finally, if your partner served in the Armed Forces and passed away, you might qualify for War Widow\u2019s or Widower\u2019s Pension. That\u2019s a thing too.  \n\nSo yeah, taxes and benefits are a big deal when someone passes, just stay on top of what you need to do and keep checking back for updates! Good luck!",

      "poorly_written_article": "So like, if you're thinking about traveling or moving overseas, you might still get some benefits from the UK, which is pretty cool, right? But it totally depends on where you go and for how long and stuff. \n\nFirst things first, if you're going abroad, just let your local Jobcentre Plus know or whoever handles your benefit payments. Super important to tell them if it\u2019s just a temporary thing, and don't forget to mention when you're coming back! Oh, and you gotta let HMRC know too if you're leaving the UK. No one wants to get in trouble for not telling the right people, you know? \n\nNow, about claiming stuff when you're abroad \u2014 if you're in a European Economic Area country or anywhere with a deal with the UK, you could possibly get UK benefits or whatever benefits from the country you're in. If you're on a State Pension, you can still claim that too, which is nice. \n\nIf you're chilling in an EEA country or Switzerland, you might be able to snag some UK benefits. So just google it or something to check it out! \n\nAbout payments, like, when will you get your cash? It all depends on your benefit type. Oh, and heads up, if your payment timeline accidentally collides with a US federal holiday, it might show up late because a US company handles the payment processing. Kinda wild, right? \n\nNow, pretend like you're playing a game called benefit fraud, which is a big no-no. If you don\u2019t tell your benefit office you\u2019re headed out, or you don't report changes like buying a house or working abroad \u2014 that's bad news. Plus, if you\u2019re dishonest just to get benefits while claiming some from another country? Yeah, don\u2019t do that. \n\nHere\u2019s a list of some places where you can still claim benefits, if you want to know. If you're eyedroping your way into an EEA country or Switzerland, you might get benefits still. \n\nThere are countries like, uh, Barbados, Bermuda, Canada, and even the USA that have agreements with the UK. If you\u2019ve contributed enough to National Insurance in the UK before you moved, you could possibly get unemployment benefits there. \n\nThen there's this thing called Universal Credit, which you can get for one month while you're abroad. Just make sure you\u2019re still eligible and also tell your work coach you\u2019re leaving. If a relative dies and it's super unreasonable for you to come back? You can get it for another month. But if you\u2019re planning to move abroad permanently? Nope, no Universal Credit. \n\nNow, if you're heading out for medical treatment, things might change a bit. You can keep getting those benefits for like six months under certain conditions \u2014 talk to your doctor for specifics. \n\nAlso, if you work in the UK and you\u2019ve got a job that sends you overseas for work duties, like military stuff, there are some special rules for you regarding Universal Credit too \u2014 you might be able to still access it but just be sure to let your work coach know before you go. \n\nAnd, oh! If you're a mariner or work on continental shelves, you might keep getting Universal Credit for six months too, which is neat. \n\nThen there's Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA), and there are two types, New Style and income-based. But income-based JSA isn't available abroad, so like, don't get your hopes up there. New Style JSA might be available for three months if you're job-hunting while out of the UK.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to countries outside the EEA but still have agreements, like Macedonia for example, you might snag some help too if you've done your contributions.\n\nOn the health side of things, if you\u2019re working for a UK employer overseas, you can get Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) but check with your employer on that. \n\nGood news mostly, though \u2014 like for Maternity Pay if you\u2019re in the EEA or Switzerland, you may still get that too! But I guess that totally depends on your employer stuff, so talk to them. \n\nAnd if you\u2019re a parent, you might still get things like Child Benefit, and also Carer\u2019s Allowance if you take a trip away. \n\nSo, ya know, if you plan to be gone longer than four weeks, tell Jobcentre Plus. The same goes if you're into disabled benefits or whatever, so be sure to check the guidelines. \n\nWhen you\u2019re about to make a move or change on your claim, just write a letter with what benefits you want and where you are \u2014 there\u2019s a mailing address for that. You\u2019ll probably want to avoid any confusion, ya know? \n\nDefinitely reach out for help when you need to! There are departments for benefits and stuff, and they have a ton of info. Really, if you have some kind of inquiry, just shoot them an email. Oh, and for anything related to bereavement benefits, if you were getting it when you moved, you\u2019ll still get it! Super straightforward \u2014 unless you moved to a random country, then it gets trickier but still possible in some places.\n\nIn short, so many rules and varying situations! But if you're diligent, you just might navigate it all and keep getting what you're owed while being all over the globe.",

You don\u2019t get a replacement for O levels, CSEs, GCSEs, or A levels. Just so you know, that certified thing works for stuff like applying to universities and stuff, instead of the actual certificate. But for other qualifications, they might just hook you up with a new piece of paper.\n\nAlso, you gotta show them you are who you say you are (identity proof or something) and you might have to pay a fee, which is annoying but whatever. Oh, and if your old exam board, like, doesn\u2019t exist anymore, check online or something. It\u2019s not rocket science or anything, just look it up.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what exam board has your results, just ask your school or college, they\u2019ll figure it out.\n\nAnyway, there are five big boards over in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland or whatever:\n\n- AQA (you can check them if you need stuff) \n- CCEA (like, for Northern Ireland things)\n- Pearson Edexcel (they do a lot of stuff)\n- OCR (Oxford,Cambridge thing)\n- WJEC (Welsh stuff) \n\nIf you need a Scottish qualification, reach out to the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) or whatever.\n\nNow, if your old exam board, like, vanished into thin air or something, you gotta figure out which one to contact for your results. No biggie.  \n\nLike, for AQA, if you were with these boards:\n- AEB \n- SEG \n- SEREB \n- SWExB \n- ALSEB \n- JMB\n- NEA \n- NEAB \n- NWREB \n- TWYLREB \n- YHREB \n\nYou just gotta contact AQA. It\u2019s pretty simple.\n\nFor CCEA, if you had these:\n- NISEAC \n- NISEC \n\nJust go ahead and talk to them or whatever.\n\nAnd if you were with Pearson Edexcel, and you had:\n- BEC \n- BTEC \n- EDI  \n- JCBSPA \n- LCCI  \n- LEAG  \n- LREB  \n- M&MREB  \n- TEC  \n- UESEC   \n- ULEAC  \n- ULSEB  \n\nJust reach out to them because they\u2019ll take care of it.\n\nIf it\u2019s OCR you need, and your old board was one of the following:\n- EMREB \n- MEG \n- OCEAC \n- OCSEB \n- RSA \n- SREB \n- SUJB \n- UCLES \n- UODLE \n- WMEB \n\nYou need them too. Oh, and if your board was the EAEB, you can contact Edexcel or OCR, since they got some of those old records or something.\n\nReal simple stuff, just reach out, pays to ask!  \n\nAlso, all those abbreviations? Yeah, they\u2019re companies or councils or whatever, just look them up online if you\u2019re curious.",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, like, qualifications have levels, you know? And higher levels mean it's harder to get, obviously. If you wanna check out the level of a qualification, there's a few ways to do it. You can look at a list for England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, or you can see the Register of Regulated Qualifications if you know the qualification's name and the exam board and stuff. Oh, and you can also compare levels from other countries if you're into that.\n\nSome qualifications at the same level might cover the same subject but in different ways. Like, take AS levels and A levels. Both are level 3, but you do AS over one year and A levels take two years, so you end up learning more in A levels!\n\nIf you\u2019re stuck on qualification levels in England, hit up the National Careers Service for help. If you\u2019re in Scotland, check out Skills Development Scotland, in Wales there\u2019s Careers Wales, and for Northern Ireland, there\u2019s Northern Ireland Direct.\n\nSo, over in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, we've got 9 qualification levels totally.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s the entry level. It has three sub-levels - 1, 2, and 3, and guess what? Entry level 3 is the hardest. Some entry level qualifications are, like, awards, certificates, and diplomas in essential skills and English for speakers of other languages (ESOL). Oh, and there\u2019s something called Skills for Life but I\u2019m not really sure what that is.\n\nThen there's level 1, which includes first certificates and GCSEs (though some people only get grades D, E, F, and G). There\u2019s also level 1 awards, and diplomas, and a bunch of other stuff like music grades. Easy peasy!\n\nLevel 2 qualifications are kinda similar; they include CSEs and GCSEs (better grades like 9-4 or whatever), and other certificates and diplomas and some apprenticeship stuff. Plus music grades 4 and 5 are here. Super straightforward.\n\nNow for level 3, you got your A levels, which everyone talks about, and access to higher education diplomas. There are also some fancy diplomas and stuff. Music grades 6, 7, and 8 hang out here too, along with T Levels, which are new or something?\n\nGoing up, level 4's where you find more serious stuff like certificates of higher education and higher apprenticeships. It\u2019s less like high school and more like college, you know?\n\nLevel 5? That\u2019s where you see diplomas of higher education and foundation degrees. Basically, it's a step up from level 4.\n\nLevel 6 is for degrees, like bachelor's and graduate diplomas, and it\u2019s pretty important for university stuff. You\u2019ve got your honors degrees and all that too.\n\nAt level 7, we get into the master's degrees, which sounds cool, and there\u2019s also a bunch of postgraduate stuff like diplomas and certificates. \n\nFinally, at level 8, which is kinda like the top, you\u2019ve got doctorates, like PhDs and stuff. Super impressive, right?  \n\nNow, if you\u2019re looking at qualifications outside the UK, they have their own systems. Scotland\u2019s got its own thing, and you can look at comparing qualifications if you want.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re peeking at qualifications in Europe or anywhere else, there\u2019s ways to compare those too. Maybe just hit up UK ENIC for non-UK stuff but keep in mind there\u2019s a fee for that, which is kinda lame. \n\nIn short, qualification levels kinda help you see how hard something is and what it leads to, or whatever.",

These do not count towards state benefits or pensions.\n\n## Help if you're not working \n\nYour benefits could be affected if there are gaps in your National Insurance record. [National Insurance credits](/national-insurance-credits) can help to avoid gaps in your record and protect your benefits.\n\nYou can get credits if you cannot pay National Insurance contributions, for example, if:\n\n  * you\u2019re unable to work due to illness\n  * you\u2019re caring for someone\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re not working or getting credits you can also top up your National Insurance with [voluntary contributions](/voluntary-national-insurance-contributions).\n\n## Change of circumstance \n\nYou must tell HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) if you:\n\n  * [change your personal details](/tell-hmrc-change-of-details), for example your name, address or marital status\n  * [start being self-employed](/register-for-self-assessment/self-employed)\n  * [stop being self-employed](/stop-being-self-employed)\n\n\n  *[HMRC]: HM Revenue and Customs\n  *[ISA]: Individual Savings Account\n  *[PAYE]: Pay As You Earn",

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so let\u2019s talk about National Insurance, or NI for short. It's this thing you pay, right? It\u2019s supposed to help you qualify for certain benefits and of course, the biggie\u2014the State Pension. You gotta have a National Insurance number, real important, so they can keep your info all straightened out and nobody else's gets mixed up with yours. You can even read this in Welsh, which is cool I guess.  \n\nNow, who actually pays this National Insurance? Well, if you\u2019re 16 or older and making more than \u00a3242 a week from a job, or if you\u2019re self-employed and making over \u00a312,570 a year, then boom, you\u2019re paying it. But if you\u2019re earning between \u00a3123 and that \u00a3242, you\u2019re kinda in a gray area where you don\u2019t usually pay, but you can still get some benefits.  \n\nSo there\u2019s different classes of National Insurance. Classes are just different types, right? They depend on if you work or don\u2019t and how much cash you make.  \n\nWhen do you stop paying? If you're working, it's when you hit State Pension age. Get this: if you're self-employed, you can stop paying either when you hit that age, or like after the tax year begins in April.  \n\nYour NI number stays with you for life, which is kinda crazy to think about honestly. It\u2019s got letters and numbers, like QQ123456B\u2014just a random made-up example! You usually get that number in the mail, around when you\u2019re about to turn 16.  \n\nNeed your number? Look for it on your payslip or P60 or something. You might even find a letter about it. And if you never had one, you can just apply.  \n\nHere\u2019s a pro-tip: keep that number secret! It\u2019s like your social security number or whatever. Only share it with certain people like HMRC, your employer, or if you need certain benefits. Just don\u2019t give it out willy-nilly because identity theft is a real pain in the butt.\n\nSo, classes again? Yeah, they change based on how much you make and if you\u2019re employed or self-employed. If you\u2019re working, your employer will snatch some cash for Class 1 contributions from your check if you\u2019re making more than \u00a3242 a week. If you\u2019re under that, you might not pay it but can still get some stuff.  \n\nAs for self-employed folks, if your profits are above \u00a36,725 you\u2019re paying Class 2. Simple as that! And if you make more, Class 4 kicks in. If you\u2019re making less, don\u2019t worry! You can pay voluntary contributions if you're worried about gaps in your NI record.  \n\nAnd yeah, if you're not working, same thing\u2014voluntary contributions exist. You can pay them to keep things solid. If you get sick or are a caregiver, you can also get credits which helps fill those gaps, you know? \n\nOh, and if your life changes, like you move or start or stop working for yourself, tell HMRC! Super important, don\u2019t ignore it.\n\nSo basically, National Insurance is a lot about keeping track of your contributions for when you need them later in life, like pensions and other benefits. Simple enough, right? Anyway, go check out those links if you want more info, if you\u2019re still interested! Cheers!",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, like, if your kid has a baby, you can get Child Benefit for that baby and your kid. It\u2019s pretty simple, just gotta be responsible for them, ya know? If your kid is claiming it, you can actually just grab the payments by chatting with their bank, which is kinda cool. But here\u2019s the thing: the Child Benefit Office will only send that cash to one account. You could do a joint account with your kid, but they gotta be on it too! Oh and by the way, this guide is also in Welsh if you\u2019re into that.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about appointees. That\u2019s like, when you\u2019re helping someone who can\u2019t handle their own Child Benefit stuff, maybe \u2018cause they\u2019re a little out of it or have some major issues. You can apply to be one \u2013 it\u2019s called becoming an appointee, duh! You can do it by yourself or through an org, like, a charity or whatever. And if you get paid to do it, then you\u2019re a \u2018paid agent\u2019\u2026 fancy, huh? Just helping fill out forms doesn\u2019t count.\n\nTo actually become an appointee, you gotta hit up the Child Benefit Office and ask them about it. They\u2019ll tell you if that\u2019s the right move for ya and what to do next. By the way, if you\u2019re friends with someone and you just wanna help them get their payments, you don\u2019t have to become an appointee.\n\nOkay, so as an appointee, you\u2019re kinda like, in charge of a few things: filling out that claim form (which is pretty easy), sorting out any letters that come from the office, letting them know if stuff changes, and stopping or restarting payments if there\u2019s drama with the High Income Child Benefit Charge. That money goes into your bank account, by the way.\n\nNow, if you wanna be a paid agent, your client needs to write a letter to the Child Benefit Office saying, \"Hey, this person can take care of my Child Benefit for me.\" Real simple, right?\n\nIf you wanna switch up an appointee or stop someone being a paid agent, you gotta write to the Child Benefit Office within a month. Gotta keep it fresh, I guess.\n\nSo, about these authorizations. The Child Benefit Helpline is only gonna talk about a claim with the legit person on the claim form, or their appointee. A partner or friend can ask basic questions, but they\u2019ve gotta be \u2018authorised\u2019.\n\nTo get that authorisation, the claimant just needs to fill out this TC689 form or write a letter with the same info and send it to the Tax Credit Office. Authorisation lasts 12 months unless they put a different date on it. It usually doesn\u2019t take long, like two days or so, but don\u2019t expect a letter saying you got it \u2013 they kinda skip that part.\n\nMore than one person can be authorized, sure, but each has to send their own TC689 form. \n\nNow, if you\u2019re doing this for a ton of clients at once, you can write to the Tax Credit Office saying you\u2019re an \u2018intermediary organisation\u2019 if you\u2019re doing it for a non-profit or something. If you have your TC689 ready, you can even get urgent authorisation online \u2013 fancy right? Oh, and keep that TC689 for seven years after it\u2019s signed. Don\u2019t lose it! \n\nIf you're acting as a paid agent, remember your client needs to send that letter to the Child Benefit Office saying you can do their Child Benefit stuff for them. If there\u2019s a High Income Child Benefit Tax Charge thing happening, they\u2019ll also have to fill out this other form called CH995 to let you handle that too.\n\nAnd if someone wants to cancel an authorisation, you just need to write again to the Child Benefit Office. That\u2019s it, it\u2019s not rocket science!",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, if a kid dies, you usually keep getting Child Benefit for like 8 weeks or so. But if the kid would\u2019ve turned 20 during those 8 weeks, then it stops on the next Monday or whatever. And oh, there\u2019s a version of this guide in Welsh too, in case you\u2019re interested!\n\n### If you already claimed stuff\n\nYou gotta tell the Child Benefit Office like ASAP if a kid you get benefits for dies. You can call or probably even send mail, I guess. Just make sure to say when the kid died\u2014super important, don\u2019t skip that!\n\n### If you haven't claimed yet\n\nIf the kid died before you sent in the claim, you can still submit one\u2014unless the poor kid was stillborn, then no claims for that. \n\n#### How to claim:\n1. Send a claim for Child Benefit in the mail\u2014you can find a form online or something.\n2. Don\u2019t forget to write down the date the kid died, like on a note or whatever.  \n3. Put your contact info and National Insurance number on there too, just in case they need to reach you.\n4. You need to attach the kid\u2019s birth registration number or adoption certificate with the form. I think you don\u2019t need to send the death certificate though, which is kind of good, right?\n\nIf you don\u2019t have the birth certificate, you can just order a new one. I mean, that\u2019s not too complicated. If the kid croaked before the week ended when they were born, the 8 weeks thingy counts from that Monday it happened. Also, Child Benefit can be backdated but only for a max of 3 months! So if you wait too long, you might miss getting more cash.\n\n### If you opted out of getting Child Benefit\n\nEven if you said you didn\u2019t want the money, you still have to tell the Child Benefit Office if the kid dies. Again, do it by phone or mail\u2014pretty straightforward. And include the date of death in that too. By the way, you won\u2019t owe that High Income Child Benefit tax charge for any payments you get after the child dies, which is, I guess, a good thing.\n\n### If a parent dies too\n\nIf one or both parents kick the bucket, you might be able to grab Child Benefit if you become the main caretaker or something for those kids. Pretty sad stuff, but you gotta report it to the Child Benefit Office pronto!\n\nYou don\u2019t need to bother telling them if you already used the Tell Us Once service, which tells a bunch of places at once, or so I\u2019ve heard. Just make sure to include the exact death date, where the kid\u2019s living now, and who\u2019s taking care of them. You can fill out a form online or call them again.\n\nAfter you tell them, they\u2019ll cancel the payments and then send you a letter confirming it, probably within 20 days or so! \n\n### Make a claim again\n\nAnd just so you know, Child Benefit doesn\u2019t just switch to you automatically. You gotta like, file a new claim if your name wasn\u2019t on the original one. Payments stop from the Monday after the death thing, and yeah, backdated stuff only for 3 months, so keep that in mind!\n\n### Bank Accounts\n\nWhen you\u2019re claiming, you can say which bank account you want the money sent to. If you were getting payments but it was going into the dead person's account, you should probably pick a different one, that makes sense, right?\n\n### Extra Stuff\n\nYou might be able to get Guardian\u2019s Allowance or Widowed Parent\u2019s Allowance on top of Child Benefit, which could be helpful! Just remember, you or your partner might still have to deal with that High Income Child Benefit tax charge for any money you get. So yeah, that\u2019s about it, I hope that helps or whatever!",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, like, if you\u2019re going to some school that\u2019s kinda far away from home and you need a place to stay during term time, there might be some cash you can get, you know? It really depends on how much money your family makes, though. But, um, just so you know, they\u2019re not going to help you pay those fancy boarding school fees. \n\nAlright, so here\u2019s what you can maybe apply for:\n\n- There\u2019s this thing called the Residential Bursary Fund (RBF) if you're at one of those special residential programs. \n- Or, you could check out the Residential Support Scheme (RSS) if you\u2019re not at one of those fancy places.\n\nNow about the RBF thingy \u2014 if you qualify, you might get some help with your accommodation costs. But, like, there\u2019s a catch: \n\nYou gotta be at least 16 but under 19 by August 31, 2024. And your college is gonna check if you really live where you say you do. If you\u2019re 19 you could still get it, but only if you started your course when you were 16 or 18, or if you got this education health and care plan (whatever that really means) \n\nAlso, your course has to be full-time, at one of these specialist residential centers, but, uh, your college will have to make sure it's far enough away that you can\u2019t just bus it everyday, you know? \n\nAs for money, the college will tell you how much you'll get based on your family\u2019s income. Plus, you can get this for up to 3 years, so, like, better than nothing right? \n\nNow, on to the RSS thing \u2013 if you think you might qualify for that, here\u2019s the list:\n\n- Again, 16 and under 19 as of August 31, 2024. \n- Your college checks if you\u2019re abiding by residency stuff. \n- You can't be on that housing benefit thing. \n- Also, your family can't make more than \u00a330,993. And yeah, you gotta be going for your first big qualification, like two A levels or a diploma.\n\nIf you\u2019re 19 and still in the same situation as above, could maybe work too. \n\nBut, your course has to be full-time, and it can't be at that posh residential center. Oh, and it should be over 15 miles or take you like 2 hours to travel there round-trip because, ya know, that\u2019s a whole thing. \n\nMoney wise? Here\u2019s a rough idea:\n\nIf your household makes up to \u00a321,000, you could get up to \u00a33,458 outside London and a bit more if you\u2019re in London.\nThen, if it\u2019s in between those numbers\u2014 like \u00a321,001 to \u00a325,704\u2014you\u2019ll get less, obviously. And more money, like \u00a330,994 or more, means nada. Hope that makes sense.\n\nAnd again, you can only grab this for 3 years max. \n\nTo claim any of this, just hit up your college's student support officer for a form and help because, like, they really know what\u2019s going on or whatever.",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, if you're looking to volunteer, you can find opportunities on a bunch of websites. First off, check out the National Association for Voluntary and Community Action or something like that. They have this site, and then there's the NCVO too, which is like, National Council for Voluntary Organisations. Also, the NHS has a volunteering site; it\u2019s like super accessible if you wanna help in healthcare stuff. If you got specific skills, you can look at Reach Volunteering\u2014this is for, you know, accountants, marketing peeps, lawyers, all those kinds of people. \n\nThen there are places like Volunteering Matters which is good for young folks and even old or disabled volunteers\u2014really inclusive, you know? Don\u2019t forget about Volunteering Wales and Volunteer Scotland too; they got their own thing going on for locals.\n\nNow about your rights as a volunteer, well, you basically don\u2019t have a contract, which means no employee rights like a regular job. But they might give you this agreement that kinda outlines what support you\u2019re getting and if you're safe and stuff. Sometimes it talks about training, health and safety, and expenses, but don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not super official like a contract, just a peek at what to expect.\n\nSo yeah, NCVO has more info about volunteers' legal things if you're curious.\n\nWhen it comes to age limits, there\u2019s no limit on how old you have to be to volunteer, which is cool, but some places won\u2019t let you if you\u2019re under 16 or above a certain age, like for insurance reasons. Also, if you\u2019re super young, like under 14, you can\u2019t even volunteer for a profit-making place, even if they won\u2019t pay you. It\u2019s kinda random how local councils have their own rules too, so watch out for that.\n\nIf you\u2019re on benefits, don\u2019t stress, you can volunteer and still get your benefits. Just make sure the volunteering is about covering costs\u2014like your bus fare to get there or whatever\u2014and you still gotta meet the benefit requirements.\n\nAnd like, if you have a criminal record, you can usually still volunteer unless it\u2019s really serious or something. Just be ready for a DBS check if you want to work with kids or vulnerable adults\u2014standard stuff.\n\nAbout money, you\u2019re not getting paid, but you might get back some expenses for food, drinks, travel, or gear you need to buy. Just keep in mind that if you\u2019re driving and get paid back more than what you spent, you might have to deal with taxes on that! Also, if you\u2019re receiving any other kind of payment or if there\u2019s a promise of a job later, you could actually be seen as an employee, which gives you more rights like minimum wage and all that good stuff.",

One can expediently peruse countless online digital platforms and websites such as the National Association for Voluntary and Community Action which, by the way, has an exhaustive array of options; furthermore, let\u2019s not forget about the National Council for Voluntary Organisations that one might also want to check out just for kicks! Added to this, NHS Volunteering and Reach Volunteering are among the entities that spew forth numerous opportunities for those willing to dedicate their time altruistically, maybe even if you possess some high-demand skills like accountancy or something, and then naturally, there is Volunteering Matters aimed at youngsters, seniors, and indeed even the disabled - it\u2019s absolutely fantastic!! Really, who wouldn\u2019t want to engage?! And let\u2019s not overlook Wales, where Volunteering Wales and Volunteer Scotland await your cheerful engagement with open arms!"

            "badly_written_snippet": "Did you know? When it comes to volunteering, the concept of a contract of employment is quite irrelevant - I mean, like, who needs that. So essentially, as a volunteer, the rights you hold are not even close to those of an employee or worker if you really stop and think about it! Often, organizations might throw together a volunteer agreement (or something of that sort) to, you know, vaguely outline the level of supervision and the type of training you\u2019re going to receive, alongside some musings about insurance coverage and health safety - and, just for fun, they might even touch on some expenses! But, let\u2019s REALITY CHECK \u2013 this isn\u2019t a contract; you\u2019re just casually floating along in the kind, unbinding sea of volunteerism!! Or like, is it even unbinding?"

There\u2019s a major lack of upper age limits when it comes to volunteering, so old folks, don\u2019t worry! But, and that's a big but, if you happen to be under the age of 16, some organizations totally do not cover you with insurance, which is, like, a bummer. Also, younger than 14? Nope! Can\u2019t volunteer for profit-driven companies whatsoever, EVEN if money goes to your piggy bank. On top of that, local councils might concoct extra crazy rules about what types of work you can partake in as a youthful individual! Isn\u2019t volunteering just the wildest ride?!?"

If you happen to be receiving benefits \u2013 and let\u2019s face it, so many people are - you can still totally volunteer and make the world a better place! But hold your horses, because it\u2019s only if the ONLY money you\u2019re getting from your volunteering gig is basically JUST to cover your expenses - think travel costs and such. Oh, and you must also keep meeting the conditions laid out for your benefits which, honestly, can be like a full time job itself, if we\u2019re being super real here!"

Your options depend on the amount of money and assets you have.\n\n## Where you can get help\n\nSpeak to a debt adviser to get help choosing the best way to deal with your debt.\n\nMoneyHelper has information about [debt management](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/money-troubles/dealing-with-debt) and [free debt advisory services](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/money-troubles/dealing-with-debt/debt-advice-locator).\n\n## Paying off your debts\n\nYou can pay your debts in instalments by setting up:\n\n  * a [Debt Management Plan](/options-for-paying-off-your-debts/debt-management-plans) which is an agreement with your creditors managed by a financial company\n  * an [Administration Order](/options-for-paying-off-your-debts/administration-orders) when you\u2019ve had a county court judgment (CCJ) or a High Court judgment (HCJ) against you for debts under \u00a35,000\n  * an [Individual Voluntary Arrangement](/options-for-paying-off-your-debts/individual-voluntary-arrangements) which is managed by an insolvency practitioner\n\n\n\nYou can also get temporary protection from your creditors through the [\u2018Breathing Space\u2019 scheme](/options-for-paying-off-your-debts/breathing-space), while still making repayments. You\u2019ll need to apply through a debt advisor.\n\nIn Scotland you can arrange a Debt Payment Programme from the [Debt Arrangement Scheme](https://www.aib.gov.uk/debt-arrangement-scheme).\n\nYou may also have the option of reaching an informal agreement with your creditors.\n\n## If you cannot pay off your debt\n\nYou can apply for a [Debt Relief Order](/options-for-paying-off-your-debts/debt-relief-orders) or [Bankruptcy Order](/becoming-bankrupt/applying-to-become-bankrupt) if you cannot pay your debts because you do not have enough money or assets you can sell.\n\nIf you cannot pay off your debts, you can be [made bankrupt](/becoming-bankrupt/if-someones-applying-to-make-you-bankrupt).\n\n## Breathing Space (Debt Respite Scheme) \n\nIf you live in England or Wales, you can get temporary protection from your creditors while you get debt advice and make a plan. This scheme is called \u2018Breathing Space\u2019.\n\nYou can get temporary protection for up to 60 days.\n\nYou\u2019ll still need to make your debt repayments.\n\nIf you get it:\n\n  * enforcement action cannot be taken against you\n  * your creditors cannot contact you about debts included in your Breathing Space\n  * your creditors cannot add interest or charges to your debt\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re getting mental health crisis treatment, your protection from creditors will be longer. It will last for the length of your treatment, plus another 30 days.\n\n## How to apply for the Breathing Space scheme\n\nTo apply for the \u2018Breathing Space\u2019 scheme, you need to talk to a debt adviser. They will submit an application on your behalf if it\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\nYou can [find a free debt adviser](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/money-troubles/dealing-with-debt/debt-advice-locator) on the MoneyHelper website. You can get confidential advice online, over the phone or in person.\n\nIf you\u2019re receiving mental health treatment and cannot speak to a debt adviser, someone else can do so on your behalf.\n\n## Costs\n\nIt\u2019s free to apply for \u2018Breathing Space\u2019, but some debt advisers may charge you a fee.\n\n## Eligibility\n\nYou must:\n\n  * not have a debt relief order (DRO), an individual voluntary arrangement (IVA), an interim order, or be an undischarged bankrupt at the time you apply\n  * not already be using the \u2018Breathing Space\u2019 scheme\n  * not have used the \u2018Breathing Space\u2019 scheme in the last 12 months, unless it was for a mental health crisis\n\n## Debt Management Plans \n\nA Debt Management Plan is an agreement between you and your creditors to pay all of your debts.\n\nDebt management plans are usually used when either:\n\n  * you can only afford to pay creditors a small amount each month\n  * you have debt problems but will be able to make repayments in a few months\n\n\n\nYou can arrange a plan with your creditors yourself or through a licensed debt management company for a fee. If you arrange this with a company:\n\n  * you make regular payments to the company\n  * the company shares the money out between your creditors\n\n\n\nMoneyHelper has information about [where to get free debt advice](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/money-troubles/dealing-with-debt/debt-advice-locator).\n\n## Get a Debt Management Plan\n\n  1. Set up a plan with a debt management company authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). [Search the Financial Services Register](https://register.fca.org.uk/) for an authorised company.\n\n  2. The company works out your monthly payments. You\u2019ll have to give details about your financial situation, for example your assets, debts, income and creditors.\n\n  3. The company contacts your creditors and asks them to agree to the plan (they do not have to).\n\n\n\n\nUnless stated in the agreement, your creditors can still:\n\n  * ask you to pay your full debt at a later date\n  * take action to recover their money even if you keep up your payments\n\n\n\n## Costs\n\nSome companies will charge:\n\n  * a set up fee\n  * a handling fee each time you make a payment\n\n\n\nMake sure you understand the costs of your plan and how you pay for it.\n\n## Eligibility\n\nDebt Management Plans can only be used to pay \u2018unsecured\u2019 debts, for example debts that have not been guaranteed against your property.\n\n## Your responsibilities\n\nYour plan can be cancelled if you do not keep up your repayments.\n\n## Administration orders \n\nAn administration order is a way to deal with debt if you have a county court or High Court judgment against you and you cannot pay in full.\n\nThe debt must be less than \u00a35,000.\n\nYou make one payment a month to your local court. The court will divide this money between your creditors.\n\nCreditors listed on the administration order cannot take any further action against you without the court\u2019s permission.\n\nMoneyHelper has information about [where to get free debt advice](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/money-troubles/dealing-with-debt/debt-advice-locator).\n\n## Get an administration order\n\nFill in an [application for an administration order (form N92)](/government/publications/form-n92-application-for-an-administration-order) and return it to your local court.\n\nThe court decides:\n\n  * how much of your debt you have to repay, for example all or just part of it\n  * how much your monthly repayments will be\n  * how long the arrangement lasts\n\n\n\nThe arrangement is known as a \u2018composition order\u2019 if you cannot pay all your debts.\n\n## Costs\n\nThere\u2019s a court fee each time you make a payment. This cannot be more than 10% of your debt.\n\n### Example\n\nIf you owe \u00a35,000 the total fee cannot be more than \u00a3500.\n\n## Eligibility\n\nYou must:\n\n  * owe less than \u00a35,000, including any interest and charges\n  * owe money to at least 2 creditors\n  * prove you can afford regular repayments, for example by giving details of your income\n  * have a county court or High Court judgment against you, which you cannot pay in full\n\n\n\n## Your responsibilities\n\nYou must keep up your repayments or the court can:\n\n  * ask your employer to take money from your wages \u2013 known as an \u2018attachment of earnings order\u2019\n  * cancel the arrangement\n\n\n\nYou may still be able to keep your business running, if you have one.\n\n## Public records\n\nYour administration order is added to the Register of Judgments, Orders and Fines.\n\nIt\u2019s usually removed 6 years after the date the order was made.\n\nYour entry is marked as \u2018satisfied\u2019 if you repay your debts in full.\n\nYou can also ask the court for a \u2018certificate of satisfaction\u2019. To do this, write to the court and send a cheque for \u00a318 (made payable to His Majesty\u2019s Courts and Tribunal Service).\n\n## Individual Voluntary Arrangements \n\nAn Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) is an agreement with your creditors to pay all or part of your debts. You agree to make regular payments to an insolvency practitioner, who will divide this money between your creditors.\n\nAn IVA can give you more control of your assets than bankruptcy.\n\nMoneyHelper has information about [where to get free debt advice](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/money-troubles/dealing-with-debt/debt-advice-locator).\n\n## Get an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)\n\nUse an [insolvency practitioner](http://www.insolvencydirect.bis.gov.uk/fip1/) to get an IVA.\n\nYour insolvency practitioner works out what you can afford to repay and how long the IVA lasts. You\u2019ll have to give details about your financial situation, for example your assets, debts, income and creditors.\n\nYour insolvency practitioner will contact your creditors. The IVA will start if the creditors holding 75% of your debts agree to it. It will apply to all your creditors, including any who disagreed to it.\n\nAn IVA will stop your creditors taking action against you for your debts.\n\n## Costs\n\nThere are usually 2 fees:\n\n  * a set up fee\n  * a handling fee each time you make a payment\n\n\n\nMake sure you know how much it\u2019s going to cost before asking an insolvency practitioner to act for you.\n\n## Your responsibilities\n\nYour IVA can be cancelled by the insolvency practitioner if you do not keep up your repayments. The insolvency practitioner can make you bankrupt.\n\nYou may still be able to keep your business running, if you have one.\n\n### Public records\n\nYour IVA will be added to the [Individual Insolvency Register](/search-bankruptcy-insolvency-register). It\u2019s removed 3 months after the IVA ends.\n\n## Debt Relief Orders \n\nDebt Relief Orders (DROs) are one way to deal with your debts if you:\n\n  * owe less than \u00a350,000\n  * do not have much spare income - usually less than \u00a375 per month\n  * do not own your home\n\n\n\nIf you have a DRO, you:\n\n  * stop making payments towards your debts (including interest) for 12 months\n  * need to follow certain rules (\u2018restrictions\u2019) during that time\n  * will not need to pay the debts or follow restrictions after 12 months\n\n\n\nA DRO can be cancelled if your financial circumstances change. It can be extended if you do not follow the restrictions.\n\nYou will still have to pay:\n\n  * your rent and bills\n  * certain debts not included in the DRO, such as student loans or court fines\n\n\n\n## Restrictions\n\nThere are restrictions on what you can do while you have a DRO.\n\nYou cannot:\n\n  * borrow more than \u00a3500 without telling the lender about your DRO\n  * act as the director of a company\n  * create, manage or promote a company without the court\u2019s permission\n  * manage a business without telling those you do business with about your DRO\n  * open a bank account without telling the bank or building society about your DRO\n\n\n\nYou may be prosecuted if you break any of these restrictions while you have a DRO.\n\n## Eligibility\n\nYou\u2019re generally eligible if you meet all of these criteria:\n\n  * you owe less than \u00a350,000\n  * you\u2019ve less than \u00a375 a month spare income\n  * you\u2019ve less than \u00a32,000 worth of assets\n  * you do not own a vehicle worth \u00a34,000 or more\n  * you\u2019ve lived or worked in England and Wales within the last 3 years\n  * you have not applied for a DRO within the last 6 years\n\n\n\n## Get a Debt Relief Order\n\n[Contact an approved debt adviser](/government/publications/getting-a-debt-relief-order) to apply for a DRO. You cannot apply for a DRO on your own.\n\nYou do not need to pay for a DRO.\n\nMoneyHelper has information about [where to get free debt advice](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/money-troubles/dealing-with-debt/debt-advice-locator).\n\n## Records\n\nYour DRO will:\n\n  * be added to the [Individual Insolvency Register](/search-bankruptcy-insolvency-register) \\- it\u2019s removed 3 months after the DRO ends\n  * stay on your credit record for 6 years - this is the same as other debt relief options\n\n\n  *[CCJ]: county court judgment\n  *[HCJ]: High Court judgment\n  *[DRO]: Debt Relief Order\n  *[IVA]: Individual Voluntary Arrangement\n  *[DROs]: Debt Relief Orders",

      "poorly_written_article": "### Overview  \nOkay, so if you owe people money, like the folks you borrowed from or whatever, you've got options for paying them back. It kinda depends on how much cash you have and what's in your wallet.  \n\n### Where to Find Help  \nTalk to a debt adviser \u2013 yeah, they can help you figure out what the best way is to deal with your money problems. There\u2019s this MoneyHelper site with info about debt stuff and they even got free debt advice.\n\n### Paying Off Debts  \nSo, here\u2019s the deal. You can pay your debts in little bits over time. You can set up like:  \n- A Debt Management Plan (DMP) which is like a promise you make with the people you owe money, and it's managed by some financial company. \n- An Administration Order if you've got a court judgment and owe under 5K.  \n- An Individual Voluntary Arrangement which is kind of similar but managed by a person who knows about insolvency. \n\nOh, and there's this 'Breathing Space' thing too \u2013 it\u2019s like a chill pill for your debts while you still pay some off. You gotta chat with a debt advisor to get in on that. If you live in Scotland, there's also a Debt Payment Programme you can try.\n\n### What If You Can\u2019t Pay?  \nIf your money situation is a mess and you can\u2019t pay back what you owe, you can try this Debt Relief Order or even go bankrupt if things are really bad. You can also get made bankrupt by creditors if you can\u2019t keep up your payments. Sounds harsh but happens.  \n\n### Breathing Space Explained  \nIf you're in England or Wales, this cool 'Breathing Space' scheme lets you get a breather from all the annoying creditors while you sort your life out \u2013 but still gotta pay your debts, though. You can have up to 60 days of peace.  \n\n### Applying for Breathing Space  \nYou gotta hit up a debt adviser to get this Breathing Space thing started. They\u2019ll do all the heavy lifting for you. You can find a no-cost adviser on MoneyHelper, like online or over the phone. \n\n### Costs  \nApplying for Breathing Space is free to get into, but be careful, cause some advisers might charge you a fee. \n\n### Eligibility Stuff  \nOkay, so not everyone can get this. You can\u2019t have a Debt Relief Order or any of that stuff at the time you apply, and you can't already be using the scheme. \n\n### Debt Management Plans  \nBasically, a DMP is, you and your creditors agree on how you'll pay them back. It helps if you're only making small payments and stuff. You can set one up by yourself or through a company, which usually charges you. \n\n### How to Set Up a DMP  \n1. Find a company that\u2019s legit and authorized by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).  \n2. They\u2019ll help you figure out what you can pay each month based on how much cash you really have.  \n3. They\u2019ll then ask your creditors if they\u2019re cool with the plan \u2013 but they don\u2019t have to agree. \n\n### Costs Again  \nSome companies might hit you with fees and stuff, so just make sure you know how that works. \n\n### Responsibilities  \nOh, and if you stop paying, your plan can get canceled real quick.  \n\n### Administration Orders  \nOkay, if you've got a court judgment and can\u2019t pay it all, you can do this administration thing for debts under 5K. It\u2019s like you pay one set amount to the court, and they spread it around your creditors.\n\n### Get an Administration Order  \nYou need to fill out this application form and send it to your local court. They\u2019ll figure out how much you owe and how long you\u2019ll pay for.  \n\n### More Costs  \nThere\u2019s like a court fee that can\u2019t be more than 10% of your debt.  \n\n### Eligibility for Admin Orders  \nYou gotta have debts under 5K, owe at least two people, and prove you can handle the payments.\n\n### Your Public Records  \nYour order will show up in the Register for about 6 years. \n\n### Individual Voluntary Arrangements  \nSo, here\u2019s another option: an IVA. It\u2019s an agreement to pay back either all or some of your debts, managed by an insolvency professional who splits your payments up.  \n\n### Setting Up an IVA  \nGet one of those insolvency practitioners to help out. They\u2019ll need your financial info and then contact your creditors. If 75% of them say cool, you\u2019re good to go.  \n\n### Costs for IVA  \nYou\u2019ll have to pay a setup fee and other handling fees, so keep an eye out for that.\n\n### Your Responsibilities for IVAs  \nIf you mess up the payments on your IVA, they can just make you bankrupt. \n\n### Debt Relief Orders  \nDROs are for if you owe like under 50K, and don\u2019t have a lot of monthly wiggle room (like under 75 bucks). You need to not own your home, too.  \n\n### In a DRO  \nFor a year, you won\u2019t be making payments or dealing with interest on debts. After that, you don\u2019t have to pay them at all.  \n\n### Restrictions Again  \nYou can\u2019t borrow more than 500 bucks without mentioning the DRO, and stuff like being a director of a company is off-limits too. \n\n### Eligibility for DROs  \nYou gotta meet all the requirements to get one, like owing less than 50K and having little assets and income.  \n\n### Apply for a DRO  \nYou can\u2019t do it yourself - gotta contact an approved debt adviser.\n\n### Records for DRO  \nYour DRO will show up and stick around for 6 years, similar to other debt options. \n\n\n  \n**[CCJ]: county court judgment  \n[HCJ]: High Court judgment  \n[DRO]: Debt Relief Order  \n[IVA]: Individual Voluntary Arrangement  \n[DROs]: Debt Relief Orders",

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay so, like, apprenticeships are these things where you basically get to train on the job and learn stuff at the same time, which is pretty cool, right? So when you\u2019re an apprentice, you\u2019re actually working as an employee, which means you get paid (yay for money!) and also get holiday pay, which is like a bonus. You\u2019ll be working with people who know what they\u2019re doing, so you\u2019ll pick up job skills specific to your role and have to study too\u2014like, you have to spend at least 20% of your work hours training (that\u2019s a thing). \n\nNow, it takes, like, anywhere from 1 to 5 years to finish an apprenticeship, depending on which level you\u2019re going for.  \n\nSpeaking of levels, let\u2019s break that down: \n\n- Intermediate is Level 2, kind of like GCSE.  \n- Advanced is Level 3, so that\u2019s your A levels or whatever.  \n- Higher covers from Level 4 to 7, which is like a foundation degree and all that.  \n- Degree is also 6 and 7, which means bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees. \n\nSometimes you can even get an extra qualification like a diploma if you do an apprenticeship, which is nice. \n\nSo who can actually do an apprenticeship? You gotta be over 16, living in England, and you can\u2019t be in full-time school. You can apply while you\u2019re still in school but you gotta be 16 before summer ends to start. \n\nIf you\u2019ve got some experience or qualifications already, you might get to finish faster, which is a win! Like, if you\u2019ve got a National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) or have done an IT course, that could help. You can chat with your employer and training provider about that. \n\nNow, just a heads up, if you\u2019re in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, the rules and who you talk to about apprenticeships might be different. There are like specific organizations for that: Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland each have their own setups. \n\nOkay, what else? As an apprentice you get paid \u2013 that\u2019s what we like \u2013 and you\u2019ll earn at least the National Minimum Wage, which is important. Plus, you get time to study! So like, it\u2019s not just work and no play. You also get holiday pay and some other employee rights, which is cool.  \n\nSo, about pay, it kinda changes with your age and how long you've been in your apprenticeship. If you\u2019re 16 to 18, you\u2019re getting \u00a36.40 an hour. If you\u2019re 19 or older and still in your first year, you also get \u00a36.40. But if you\u2019re over 19 and done your first year, you get the National Minimum Wage for your age, which can be more. You might wanna check if you're getting your minimum wage right; there's a calculator for that.  \n\nFor a job, you should be paid for your normal hours and also for the training (that 20% we talked about). You also get paid for studying English and Maths if that\u2019s part of your gig. Your working hours will be in your contract \u2013 so keep an eye on it to know what\u2019s up!  \n\nTraining is a biggie too; you\u2019ll have to set aside that 20% of your hours for training. This could happen like every week or every month, could be at work or at a training center, or even online.\n\nTalking holidays, you get at least 20 paid days vacation plus bank holidays every year. If you\u2019re curious, there\u2019s a holiday calculator online to figure that one out.  \n\nIf you\u2019ve been in local authority care, and you\u2019re under 25, you might be eligible for some bursary cash when you start. Just check with your training provider about that stuff. \n\nGot questions? Your school, college, or training provider might help. There\u2019s this thing called the Apprentice Support Centre for more info as well.  \n\nTo apply for an apprenticeship, it\u2019s pretty simple: \n1. Search for one.  \n2. Make an account or log in.  \n3. Fill out the application and send it off.  \n\nOh, and if you don\u2019t get accepted, you can ask for feedback on why, and if you think something unfair happened during the application or interview, you can complain about it. \n\nYou can reach the Apprenticeship helpline if you need help, and they\u2019re there Monday to Friday during normal hours. \n\nSo, like, that\u2019s the scoop on apprenticeships!",

The duration of apprenticeships can range from 1 to 5 years, depending on their level.",

You earn a wage, of course, and get holiday pay, which is super applicable! You also get to work side-by-side with seasoned professionals, like, just imagine the learning opportunities!! And oh, you will totally gain some seriously job-specific skills while having your brain nourished with training and study time - at least 20% of your working hours gonna be spent on this training, isn\u2019t that amazing?? The span of these apprenticeships can be tricky, anywhere from one to the mind-boggling five years, subject to their operational level!!"

Higher levels act on a different plane, which are Levels 4 through 7 (wow!!) and they align with those foundation degrees - how vital is that?!

If you get a grant, you do not need to repay it. Ask your college or training provider about grants before you apply for a loan.\n\nIf someone is claiming an [Adult Dependants\u2019 Grant](/adult-dependants-grant) on your behalf, the amount of money they get could be affected if you successfully apply for an Advanced Learner Loan.\n\nDifferent funding is available if you want to study in Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales.

These are in addition to the repayments you must make when your income is over the threshold amount and are not compulsory.\n\n## Access to Higher Education (HE) course\n\nStudent Finance England will \u2018write off\u2019 any outstanding Advanced Learner Loan balances you owe for an Access to HE course once you complete a higher education course. This means you do not have to repay it.\n\nThe higher education course must be [eligible for student finance](https://www.gov.uk/student-finance/who-qualifies).\n\nIf you made extra repayments towards your Advanced Learner Loan before starting a Higher Education course, these repayments are non-refundable.\n\n## Loan Bursary Fund\n\nYou may also be eligible for money from the Advanced Learner Loan [Bursary Fund](/advanced-learner-loan/bursary-fund) if you need help with some costs while studying, for example childcare, travel or trips related to your course.\n\nUse MoneyHelper to [work out the cost of borrowing](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/everyday-money/credit-and-purchases/how-to-work-out-the-true-cost-of-borrowing).\n\n## What you'll get \n\nHow much you get depends on:\n\n  * the type of course\n  * your course fees\n  * the maximum loan available for your course\n\n\n\nIt only covers your course fees, not your living costs.

But hey, before you jump into applying, check out if you're eligible first because that\u2019s important. \n\nNow, if you\u2019re doing a level 3 qualification, you might actually wanna look into an 'Adult Education Budget' grant instead. That\u2019s a freebie\u2014no repayments needed! Just ask your college about it before you dive into loans, alright? Oh, and if someone's getting an Adult Dependants\u2019 Grant for you or whatever, your loan application could mess with that, so keep that in mind.\n\nAnd by the way, if you\u2019re in Scotland, Northern Ireland, or Wales, the funding stuff is different. You can check out funding info for students in those areas if you wanna know more. Just search it up:\n- Scotland funding\n- Northern Ireland funding\n- Wales funding \n\nOn to the repayment fun\u2014 you only start paying back the loan when you're making over a certain amount, which they call, um, the 'threshold'? And yeah, you get charged interest right from the first payment, which kinda sucks, but that\u2019s how it is. You can pay more anytime if you wanna, but you don\u2019t have to. \n\nOh, and if you finish your Access to HE course and then head into a higher education course, any leftover loan balance can get wiped clean. No need to pay that back, sweet deal! Just make sure your HE course qualifies for student finance or else it won\u2019t work out. If you tossed in extra repayments before starting your higher ed, those don\u2019t come back, so keep an eye on that. \n\nAlso, there\u2019s this Loan Bursary Fund that you can tap into if you need help with extra costs like childcare or travel for your course. Um, you can use MoneyHelper to figure out how borrowing costs can pile up before you take the leap. \n\nNow, how much cash you can get totally varies depending on the type of course and what the fees are, and it only really covers course fees\u2014not your living expenses, which is something you might wanna remember. You can borrow a minimum of \u00a3300 but it goes straight to the school or provider. You don\u2019t have to borrow everything, just a heads up\u2014you can pitch in some of your own money if that makes sense for you.\n\nYou can put in for up to 4 loans, and yeah, you can have more than one at the same time, which is neat. If you wanna take the same level course again, like a different subject, that\u2019s fine, but you only ask once for an Access to HE course. \n\nWhen it comes to A levels, just so you know, you can borrow money for each course, up to 4 A levels total, meaning 8 loans if you count taking two courses for each A level. Make sure they\u2019re the same subject though to qualify for each full A. You can snag loans for extra courses too before or after your A levels. \n\nSo, about being eligible\u2014 it\u2019s all about your age and what course you\u2019re taking, plus where you\u2019re studying. You gotta be at least 19 on the course start date. The course itself has to be at a recognized college and should be at least a Level 3 qualification or up. If you\u2019re going for a Level 4 or 5 course, go for undergrad student finance instead. Just ask the college if you\u2019re unsure.  \n\nAs for your nationality, most of the time you\u2019ll need to be living in the UK on course day, and you gotta be a UK national or have settled status, which is no big deal, or been here for 3 years excluding short trips. If you were in the EU or any of those other places and came back, you might still be able to get this loan, but look up the exact criteria for that. \n\nIf you\u2019re from certain countries like, uh, Switzerland or the EU, you need settled or pre-settled status, plus you need to have lived in the UK or those areas for 3 years. Irish folks don\u2019t need any visa stuff, lucky them! Also, if your residency status is a bit complicated, you might still qualify, like if you\u2019ve been living here for a while or you\u2019re a refugee. \n\nOkay, so how to apply? First things first, check with your college that your course is good for the loan. Then, get a letter from them (it's called the \u2018Learning and funding information\u2019 letter) to kickstart your application. After that, just head online and apply, or you can mail in an application if you can\u2019t do it online. You should hear back about your loan in about 2 weeks if you apply online, which is faster than by mail. \n\nRemember, you need that letter before applying. Oh and you can do the application without a National Insurance number, but you gotta have one when it\u2019s time to get the cash. \n\nAnd for proof of identity, if you\u2019ve got a UK passport, awesome\u2014include that! If it\u2019s expired or you don\u2019t have one, you\u2019ll need to mail your birth certificate instead. Don\u2019t send the passport itself though, just the details.  \n\nTo check if you need to send any extra info or supporting documents, you\u2019ll have to touch base with your college on how they wanna handle that. If something goes awry with the bursary fund money, just reach out to them to appeal. \n\nIn conclusion(ish), it\u2019s a lot to juggle, but it\u2019s possible to get financial help to make studying doable!",

Your report may not be investigated unless you do.\n\n## Legal advice\n\nYou can get free legal advice about schooling and education from [Child Law Advice](http://childlawadvice.org.uk/).\n\n## State schools \n\nState schools include:\n\n  * maintained schools\n\n  * academies and free schools\n\n\n\n\nCall 999 if a child is in immediate danger. Contact your local council or call your local police on 101 if you think a child is at risk.\n\n## Complain to the school\n\nContact the school to discuss the problem first - most problems can be solved this way.\n\nYou can make an informal complaint. The school will tell you when they will respond. After they review your complaint, you\u2019ll be told the outcome.\n\nIf the problem is not resolved, follow the school\u2019s complaints procedure to make a formal complaint.\n\n\u200b\u200bEvery school in England must have one. It\u2019s usually available on the school\u2019s website or from the school office and should tell you the kind of complaints the school deals with.\n\nYou may not be able to complain to academies or free schools if you do not have a child at the school.\n\n## Complain to DfE\n\nYou need to complete the school\u2019s complaints procedure before you complain to DfE, unless one of the following applies:\n\n  * a child is not getting an education\n  * a child has been exposed to harm\n  * the school is stopping you from following its complaints procedure\n\n\n\nDfE will consider your complaint. They may use the information you provide to recommend improvements to school policies.\n\nDfE cannot deal with complaints about:\n\n  * fines for taking holidays in term time (sometimes known as a \u2018fixed penalty notice\u2019)\n\n  * lack of compensation or apologies from the school\n\n  * the behaviour of school staff\n\n\n\n\nIf you have followed all the steps in the school\u2019s complaints procedure and believe your complaint was not dealt with correctly, you can [complain to DfE](/complain-to-dfe).\n\n## Complain to Ofsted\n\nIf you\u2019ve complained to the school and the problem has not been resolved, you can complain to Ofsted. This does not mean that Ofsted will then inspect the school.\n\nThey will record your complaint, and may use the information you\u2019ve provided to help them decide what areas to focus their next inspection on.\n\nOfsted considers complaints about things that affect the whole school rather than individuals.\n\nOfsted cannot:\n\n  * resolve issues between you and the school\n\n  * ask the school to respond directly to your complaint or take action on it\n\n  * change the outcome of a complaint\n\n  * change the school\u2019s complaints process because of a complaint\n\n\n\n\nYou can [complain about a state school to Ofsted](/complain-to-ofsted).\n\n## Private schools \n\n[Contact your local council](/report-child-abuse-to-local-council) or call your local police on 101 if you think a child is at risk.\n\nCall 999 if a child is in immediate danger.\n\n## Make a complaint\n\nFollow the school\u2019s complaints procedure - every school in England must have one. It should be published on the school\u2019s website.\n\nIt should tell you what kind of complaints the school will deal with, such as bullying or bad behaviour.\n\nYou cannot complain directly to a private school if you do not have a child at the school.\n\n### Further complaints\n\nThe Department for Education (DfE) cannot investigate individual complaints about private schools. But it has certain powers as a regulator if the school is not meeting standards set by DfE for:\n\n  * education\n  * pupil welfare and health and safety\n  * school premises\n  * staff suitability\n  * making information available to parents\n  * spiritual, moral, social or cultural development of students\n\n\n\nDfE will consider any reports of a major failure to meet the standards. It can arrange an emergency inspection to look at pupil welfare and health and safety, and make sure serious failings are dealt with.\n\nDfE can ask the school inspectorates to take minor complaints into account when the school is next inspected.\n\nYou can complain to the DfE by filling in the [school complaints form](https://form.education.gov.uk/service/Contact_the_Department_for_Education).\n\n## Special educational needs (SEN) \n\nIf you want to complain about a school\u2019s [SEN support](/children-with-special-educational-needs), you should do it while your child is still registered at the school.\n\nThis includes complaints that the school has not provided the support required by your child\u2019s education, health and care (EHC) plan.\n\nThere\u2019s a different process if you [disagree with a decision your local authority has made about an EHC plan](/appeal-ehc-plan-decision).\n\nBefore making a complaint, talk to the school\u2019s special educational needs co-ordinator (SENCO) to try and find a solution.\n\nIf the school does not have a SENCO, ask them who you should raise your concerns with.\n\n## If you\u2019re not happy after talking to the school\n\nYou can make a formal complaint to the school.\n\n\u200b\u200bAsk the school or check their website for how to make a formal complaint. They may tell you to raise the complaint with your [local authority](https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council).\n\nCheck if the school has an \u2018SEN Information Report\u2019. This will usually outline how to complain to them about SEN provision.\n\nIf you do not want to make a formal complaint, your local authority may offer a \u2018disagreement resolution service\u2019 that can help resolve your disagreement about SEN support. Contact your [local authority](https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council) or check their website for their \u2018SEND local offer\u2019 for details.\n\n## If the school or local authority cannot solve the problem\n\nYou can [complain to the Department for Education (DfE)](https://form.education.gov.uk/service/Contact_the_Department_for_Education).\n\nThey can ask the school to take action if they find your complaint was not handled correctly.\n\nDfE cannot normally change the decision, but they can look into how it was made and ask the school to take action where appropriate.\n\n## Disability discrimination \n\nFollow the school\u2019s complaints process [if you believe a school has discriminated against someone because of their disability](/rights-disabled-person/education-rights).\n\nIf this does not solve the problem, or you do not want to complain to the school first, you may be able to complain to the Special Educational Needs and Disability (SEND) tribunal.\n\n## Who can complain to the SEND tribunal\n\nYou can complain to the tribunal if you\u2019re:\n\n  * someone with parental responsibility for a young person, or their foster parent or carer\n  * a young person over [school leaving age](/know-when-you-can-leave-school) but under 18\n\n\n\nYou can complain to the tribunal about:\n\n  * a school, nursery or pupil referral unit maintained by a local authority\n  * an independent school\n  * a free school, including an academy\n\n\n\nYou cannot complain to the tribunal about:\n\n  * a private nursery, unless it\u2019s part of a school\n  * a further education college\n  * an organisation using a school\u2019s premises\n\n\n\n## Complain to the SEND tribunal\n\nYou must send your complaint to the tribunal within 6 months of the discrimination taking place. If you send your complaint more than 6 months later, you\u2019ll be asked to explain why.\n\nYour complaint can include events which happened more than 6 months ago, as long as these directly relate to events that have taken place in the last 6 months.

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so here\u2019s the deal with complaining about schools in England. Depending on where your kid goes, like if it\u2019s a state school or a private school, there are different ways to whine about stuff. If your kid\u2019s got special educational needs, that\u2019s a whole other route too.\n\nSo, schools might just shrug off complaints about things that happen outside of school hours or even off the school grounds. You should peek at their behavior policy to see if they actually care about those things or not.  And like, if you're in Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland, there are different flavors of complaints for those places too.\n\nAnd get this, for some complaints, you gotta bug different agencies. Like if it\u2019s about child protection, you hit up the local council. If it\u2019s about criminal stuff, call the police. Or for data issues, it\u2019s the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office. If discrimination\u2019s the name of the game, then the Equality Advisory and Support Service is your friend!\n\nNow, about the teachers \u2013 if they do something really bad, like being creepy or violent, you can report them to the Teaching Regulation Agency. But seriously, you gotta jump through the school\u2019s complaint hoops first, or they might just toss your report in the trash.\n\nNeed legal advice? There\u2019s some free help you can snag from Child Law Advice.\n\nAnd just so you know, state schools cover maintained schools and academies. If you think a kid\u2019s in immediate danger, like seriously, call 999 fast! Otherwise, you talk to your local council or police if it\u2019s more of a \u2018oh, they might be at risk\u2019 kind of deal.\n\nSo, if you got a problem with a school, just call them first, because most stuff can be settled that way. You can file an informal complaint and they\u2019ll say when they're gonna get back to you \u2013 like \"hey, we\u2019ll update you soon\" or something. If things don\u2019t get sorted, then follow their formal complaints procedure; it should be on their website. Every school has to have one of those by the way. Oh, and fun fact: you might not even get to complain about academies if you don\u2019t have a kid there. Crazy, right?\n\nAlright, moving on to telling DfE about your problems. Before you poke them, make sure you\u2019ve checked off all your complaints at the school first, unless something seriously sketchy is going on like a kid not getting an education or maybe they're in danger.\n\nBut DfE won\u2019t help if you\u2019re all about those fines for taking kids on vacation during school or if you want a sorry or money from the school for something. It\u2019s just not gonna happen.\n\nComplaining to Ofsted is also a thing if the school\u2019s not sorting things out. They\u2019ll keep your complaint on record, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll come inspect the school just because you said something.\n\nIf your kid\u2019s in a private school, you can\u2019t complain directly unless you're a parent. You gotta follow their complaint process too.\n\nNow about special educational needs (SEN) \u2013 gotta put in your complaint while your kid\u2019s still in school, especially if they\u2019re missing out on support they\u2019re supposed to have. Talking to the SEN coordinator first can help, you know?\n\nAnd if none of that\u2019s working and you\u2019re still upset, you could complain to the DfE again - they might have a word with the school if they dropped the ball.\n\nAnd if someone\u2019s being discriminated against because of their disability, again, go through the school first. But remember, if they aren\u2019t listening, you can try to complain to like, this special tribunal that deals with that stuff. There\u2019s a whole process to it, and you gotta act within six months of the incident.\n\nAttending hearings can happen online, but if you need to be present, it\u2019ll be nearby.\n\nAnd remember, if your complaint actually goes through, the school has to do what the tribunal says within a certain time frame. If they don\u2019t, you can call the Local Government Ombudsman.\n\nSo yeah, complaints can be a bit of a rollercoaster, just be sure to keep everything documented and know you're not alone in this! \n\nAnd lastly, if you find they mishandled stuff or you think they messed up, you can ask for a redo or say, \"hey, I want to appeal this!\" Just keep a cool head about it all!",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, like, if you're taking care of a kid whose parents have died, you might be able to get this thing called Guardian\u2019s Allowance. I think there's also a chance you can get it if there's like one parent still around, but that's a bit trickier. You can even read it in Welsh if that's your thing, I guess. \n\nSo, the allowance is like \u00a321.75 a week, which is pretty good I guess? It's tax-free too! And you get it on top of, uh, Child Benefit, which is nice because who doesn\u2019t want more money, right? Don't forget you gotta tell the Guardian\u2019s Allowance Unit if anything changes in your life though, like something super important happens.\n\nYou get that cash every four weeks usually, but if you\u2019re a single parent or getting like certain benefits, you might get it weekly. You can have it paid into any bank account, as long as it's not a Nationwide Building Society account that's not in your name. I mean, that's a fair rule, I suppose.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t worry, that money doesn\u2019t count against other stuff like tax credits or Income Support or whatever. And like if you decide not to take Child Benefit, Guardian\u2019s Allowance can keep coming your way, which is cool. And it also doesn\u2019t count when they look at caps on benefits, so win-win. I guess you could use a benefits calculator or something to check what you're eligible for, which sounds smart.\n\nNow here\u2019s the deal for being able to get it: you gotta be raising someone else\u2019s kid, and that kid's parents need to be gone, like, totally passed away. You also have to be eligible for Child Benefit, so keep that in mind. One of the parents needs to have been born in the UK or lived here forever or something like that. Oh, and if you adopt a kid, you can still get the allowance if you were already receiving it before you adopted them. That\u2019s good to know. \n\nIf there\u2019s just one parent left, you can still get it under some conditions\u2014like if you can't find them after trying really hard, or if they were divorced and don\u2019t have custody, or if they\u2019re in prison for, like, a long time or whatever. You should probably double-check with a benefits calculator again just to be sure what you might be able to claim.\n\nTo claim this Guardian\u2019s Allowance, honestly, just do it as soon as the kid moves in with you so you don\u2019t lose out on what you could get. Just fill out this form called BG1 and send it along with the kid's birth certificate and the death certificates or whatever for the parents. Don't send copies, send the real deal, you know? And you should also sign up for Child Benefit? Like, right after.\n\nOh, and by the way, if you disagree with any decision they make, you can ask for something called mandatory reconsideration. Sounds fancy, huh? \n\nIf your situation changes, you need to tell them right away or it could mess with how much you get or even stop your payments, which would suck. So keep an eye on stuff like if the kid moves out, or if you go abroad, or if anything changes with the surviving parent. You can let them know by phone or write them a letter or something.",

A contract is an agreement that sets out an employee\u2019s:\n\n  * employment conditions\n  * rights\n  * responsibilities\n  * duties\n\n\n\nThese are called the \u2018terms\u2019 of the contract.\n\nEmployees and employers must stick to a contract until it ends (for example, by an employer or employee giving notice or an employee being dismissed) or until the terms are changed (usually by agreement between the employee and employer).\n\nIf a person has an agreement to do some work for someone (like paint their house), this is not an employment contract but a \u2018contract to provide services\u2019.\n\n[Find out more about employment contracts](https://www.acas.org.uk/employment-contracts) on the Acas (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service) website.\n\n## Accepting a contract\n\nAs soon as someone accepts a job offer they have a contract with their employer. An employment contract does not have to be written down.\n\n## Contract terms \n\nThe legal parts of a contract are known as \u2018terms\u2019. An employer should make clear which parts of a contract are legally binding.\n\nContract terms could be:\n\n  * in a written contract, or similar document like a written statement of employment\n  * verbally agreed\n  * in an employee handbook or on a company notice board\n  * in an offer letter from the employer\n  * required by law (for example, an employer must pay employees at least the National Minimum Wage)\n  * in [collective agreements](/employment-contracts-and-conditions/collective-agreements) \\- negotiated agreements between employers and trade unions or staff associations\n  * implied terms - automatically part of a contract even if they\u2019re not written down\n\n\n\n## Implied terms\n\nIf there\u2019s nothing clearly agreed between you and your employer about a particular issue, it may be covered by an implied term - for example:\n\n  * employees not stealing from their employer\n  * your employer providing a safe and secure working environment\n  * a legal requirement like the right to a minimum of 5.6 weeks\u2019 paid holidays\n  * something necessary to do the job like a driver having a valid licence\n  * something that\u2019s been done regularly in a company over a long time like paying a Christmas bonus\n\n## Collective agreements \n\nAn employer may have an agreement with employees\u2019 representatives (from trade unions or staff associations) that allows negotiations of terms and conditions like pay or working hours. This is called a collective agreement.\n\nThe terms of the agreement could include:\n\n  * how negotiations will be organised\n  * who will represent employees\n  * which employees are covered by the agreement\n  * which terms and conditions the agreement will cover\n\n## Written statement of employment particulars \n\nAn employer must give [employees and workers](/employment-status) a document stating the main conditions of employment when they start work. This is known as a \u2018written statement of employment particulars\u2019. It is not an employment contract.\n\nThe written statement is made up of:\n\n  * the main document (known as a \u2018principal statement\u2019)\n  * a wider written statement\n\n\n\nThe employer must provide the principal statement on the first day of employment and the wider written statement within 2 months of the start of employment.\n\nEmployers must tell employees or workers about any changes to the written statement. They must do this within one month of making the change.\n\nThere are special rules for agencies on documents that they need to provide to [agency workers](/agency-workers-your-rights/basic-information-you-should-receive).\n\n## The principal statement\n\nThe principal statement must include at least:\n\n  * the employer\u2019s name\n  * the employee\u2019s or worker\u2019s name, job title or a description of work and start date\n  * how much and how often an employee or worker will get paid\n  * hours and days of work and if and how they may vary (also if employees or workers will have to work [on Sundays](/sunday-working), [during the \u2018night period\u2019](/night-working-hours) or [take overtime](/overtime-your-rights/overview))\n  * [holiday entitlement](/holiday-entitlement-rights) (and if that includes public holidays)\n  * where an employee or worker will be working and [whether they might have to relocate](/employer-relocation-your-rights)\n  * if an employee or worker works in different places, where these will be and what the employer\u2019s address is\n  * how long a job is expected to last (and what the end date is if it\u2019s a fixed-term contract)\n  * how long any probation period is and what its conditions are\n  * any other benefits (for example, childcare vouchers and lunch)\n  * obligatory training, whether or not this is paid for by the employer\n\n\n\nFor employees, it must also include the date that a previous job started if it counts towards a period of continuous employment.\n\n### Working abroad\n\nIf an employee or worker has to work outside the UK for more than a month, the principal statement must also include:\n\n  * how long they\u2019ll be abroad\n  * what currency they\u2019ll be paid in\n  * what additional pay or benefits they\u2019ll get\n  * terms relating to their return to the UK\n\n\n\n### Other information the employer must give on day one\n\nOn the first day of employment the employer must also provide the employee or worker with information about:\n\n  * sick pay and procedures\n  * other paid leave (for example, maternity leave and paternity leave)\n  * notice periods\n\n\n\nThe employer can choose whether to include this information in the principal statement or provide it in a separate document. If they provide it in a separate document, this must be something that the employee or worker has reasonable access to, such as on the employer\u2019s intranet.\n\n## The wider written statement\n\nEmployers must give employees and workers a wider written statement within 2 months of the start of employment. This must include information about:\n\n  * pensions and pension schemes\n  * [collective agreements](/employment-contracts-and-conditions/collective-agreements)\n  * any other right to non-compulsory training provided by the employer\n  * disciplinary and grievance procedures\n\n## Problems with a written statement \n\nIf an employee or worker has a problem receiving their written statement, they can:\n\n  1. Try to solve the problem with their employer informally.\n\n  2. If this does not work, [take out a grievance](/raise-grievance-at-work) against their employer (employers can also get advice about handling grievances).\n\n  3. Take a case to an [employment tribunal](/employment-tribunals/taking-a-case-to-an-employment-tribunal) as a last resort.\n\n\n\n\nThe tribunal will decide what the employment particulars in the statement should have been.\n\n## Compensation\n\nIf an employee or worker wins a case about another issue (for example, unauthorised deductions from their wage slip), the tribunal may award compensation if there\u2019s been a problem with their written statement as well.\n\nCompensation can be up to 4 weeks\u2019 pay although there\u2019s a limit on how much a tribunal will award for a week\u2019s pay.\n  *[Acas]: Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service",

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so first off, every worker has this thing called an employment contract with their boss, right? Basically, it's just an agreement that tells employees what\u2019s what, like, the rules of the job and what you\u2019re supposed to do. This includes what you\u2019re paid, what you have to do, and what your boss has to do for you. Those are the terms or whatever.\n\nNow, you and your boss gotta stick to the contract until it's over, like if someone quits or gets fired, or if you change stuff together, like all friendly-like. If you\u2019re just doing a job for someone, like painting their place, don\u2019t get it confused with a job contract, it\u2019s called a 'contract to provide services' or something like that. \n\nWant more info? Just check out the Acas website, they\u2019ve got loads of stuff on employment contracts and stuff.\n\nSo like, once you say yes to a job, bam, you got a contract. And here\u2019s the thing, it doesn\u2019t even have to be written down. Wild, right?\n\nAlright, moving on to contract terms \u2013 that\u2019s like the legal bits and pieces of the contract. Your boss should be upfront about which parts you gotta follow legally. \n\nThese terms can be:\n- Written down in a contract or a statement\n- Something you agreed verbally, like just talking about it\n- Maybe mentioned in an employee handbook or stuck on a company board\n- In the job offer letter from your boss\n- Stuff required by law, like they gotta pay you at least minimum wage \u2013 no cheating there!\n- In collective agreements between bosses and unions, which is just a fancier way of saying they\u2019re working things out with a group\n- Or they could be implied terms, which are just kinda expected, like not stealing stuff or your boss giving you safe work conditions.\n\nImplied terms are things that you just sorta know, but aren\u2019t spelled out \u2013 like you shouldn\u2019t steal, your boss has to keep the place safe, and you get at least 5.6 weeks of paid vacay.\n\nNow let\u2019s chat about collective agreements. Sometimes bosses and employee reps (like union folks) agree to talk stuff out like pay and working hours. This is called a collective agreement. These agreements can cover things like:\n- How the talks will happen\n- Who\u2019s gonna talk for the employees\n- Which workers are involved in the talks\n- Which terms will be included\n\nAlso, when you start a job, your employer has to give you a written statement of your employment conditions. This isn\u2019t a whole contract but basically what you need to know when you start. \n\nThat written statement has:\n- The main stuff, called a 'principal statement'\n- A wider written statement that includes more details, which they gotta give you within 2 months, like how much you\u2019ll be paid, your working hours, holiday and stuff like that.\n\nYour boss should give you this principal statement on your first day, and if anything changes later, they gotta tell you within a month.\n\nIf you end up working outside the UK for more than a month, the principal statement also needs to have details like how long you\u2019ll be away and what currency you get paid in. \n\nOn your first day, they also gotta tell you about sick pay and any leave you might get, like maternity or paternity leave. Easy peasy, right? This can be part of the big statement or in something separate.\n\nOkay, now if there\u2019s a problem with getting that written statement, you can try talking to your boss first. If that flops, you can file a grievance or go to an employment tribunal \u2013 which is like a last-ditch effort to sort it out. The tribunal checks what should have been in your statement and can give you compensation if something went wrong.\n\nAnd just FYI, if you win a case about something else, like if your pay was messed up, the tribunal can give you cash if your written statement was an issue too! But there are limits on how much you can get, up to four weeks\u2019 pay. So yeah, that\u2019s the gist of it!",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, like, here\u2019s the deal with the Child Tax Credit. You can only grab it if you\u2019re already getting this thing called Working Tax Credit. If you can\u2019t get Child Tax Credit, no worries, just apply for Universal Credit instead. Oh, and if you and your partner are old enough, like at State Pension age, you might check out this thing called Pension Credit too.\n\nNow, what\u2019s in it for you? Well, it kinda depends on how many kids you have, ya know? And whether you\u2019re making a whole new claim or already on it. Cool thing is, getting Child Tax Credit won\u2019t mess with your Child Benefit, which is nice.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re putting in a brand new claim, remember you gotta already have that Working Tax Credit. And you can only claim for kids you\u2019re responsible for, which is just common sense, right?\n\nAbout the amount, it changes based on when your kids were born. If all of them showed up before April 6, 2017, you can get the child element for all of them plus this basic cash called the family element.\n\nBut if one or more kiddos popped out after that date - which is like, super recent - then you only get paid for two kids. Maybe more if you fit into some exception thingy. You\u2019ll only get that family element if you still have at least one child from before that date.\n\nOh, and speaking of money, here are the rates for 2024 to 2025:\n\n- Family element: up to \u00a3545\n- For each child: up to \u00a33,455\n- For disabled kids: an extra \u00a34,170\n- And if they\u2019re like severely disabled, an extra \u00a31,680 on top of that.\n\nNow, if you just moved from the EEA since July 1, 2014, you\u2019ve gotta wait three months to claim Child Tax Credit if you\u2019re not working. But hey, some people don\u2019t have to wait, like refugees or something, so check that out.\n\nIf you\u2019re already claiming, your cash amount relies on what\u2019s going on in your life. Make sure to let HMRC know if anything changes. \n\nFor those claims before April 6, 2017, you\u2019re getting that basic amount and a child element for older kids. If you have a new kid after that, you usually only get the child element for that one if it\u2019s your second kid you're claiming.\n\nBut if you started your claim after April 6, 2017, you can get the element for just two kids. Still, if they were all born before that date, you\u2019re golden!\n\nMore rates for 2024 to 2025, just in case you forgot:\n\n- Family element: \u00a3545\n- Child element for each kid: \u00a33,455\n- Extra for disabled kids: \u00a34,170\n- Extra for severe disability: \u00a31,680\n\nIf anything changes with your income or life stuff, give HMRC a shout to see how it affects your credits.\n\nAbout payments - all the benefits, like pensions and stuff, go into an account, could be a bank account, the one who\u2019s mainly responsible for the child. Payments happen weekly or every four weeks, starting from when you claim until the tax year ends unless something changes.\n\nWhen it comes to claiming, remember if you\u2019re getting Working Tax Credit, you just update that claim to include the Child Tax Credit. If you don\u2019t have Working Tax Credit, you totally can\u2019t apply, but Universal Credit is out there waiting for you.\n\nAnd for responsibility \u2013 you can only claim if you\u2019re really responsible for the kiddos. Generally, if they live with you all the time or you\u2019re their main carer, that counts. You pay for their stuff or they stuff is at your place, then it\u2019s probably you, right? If there\u2019s confusion about who claims, you can both apply and HMRC will just figure it out. \n\nAlso, if you\u2019ve adopted or fostered, you can claim for those kids too, unless you\u2019re getting some cash from the council. If that's the case, give HMRC a call. \n\nLastly, if one of your kids has a disability, you could be in line for more cash if they get some benefits like Disability Living Allowance or if they\u2019re blind, even if the payments stop when they go to the hospital, you still qualify.  \n\nSo, like, just check in with HMRC if you\u2019re unsure about any of this stuff or what you can claim.",

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so like, Child Benefit is usually given out every four weeks, right? It comes on a Monday or Tuesday, but if it's a bank holiday then the date kinda changes, you know? Also, if you\u2019re a single parent or on some specific benefits like Income Support, you might be able to get it weekly, which is super nice. Oh, and by the way, they have this guide that\u2019s in Welsh too if you need that.\n\nNow, about your first payment. You gotta check your award notice to see when you\u2019re supposed to get that first payment. It\u2019s like, counted from that date you see there and then four weeks ahead for the next payment. But, heads up \u2013 you might have to wait like 12 weeks or more, especially if you just moved to the UK. Totally annoying! At least they\u2019ll backdate it for up to three months.\n\nTo figure out when the next payment is, just do the four-week count from your last payment. But remember, don\u2019t count that if you got paid on a bank holiday 'cause those dates shift around, okay? \n\nIf you wanna see when you last got paid, check your bank statement. The payment will start with \u2018HMRC Child Benefit\u2019 and it's got this long reference with 18 characters. You could also peep your payment history online, but you gotta log in for that. You might need to show ID, like a passport or a driver\u2019s license, which is just a way to keep your stuff safe, I guess.\n\nIf your payment isn\u2019t in yet, first, look at your payment date and talk to your bank before calling the Child Benefit Office about it being late. Your payments might\u2019ve stopped if you forgot to tell them something like your bank info changed or what\u2019s up with your child after they turn 16. Or maybe you didn\u2019t respond to a letter from them, or your kid moved in with someone else, or you just can\u2019t claim it anymore. It\u2019s kinda important to update them on any changes too.\n\nOh, and when it comes to bank holidays, your Child Benefit payment's usually paid differently, right? So if it's due on a bank holiday, you gotta check the changing dates. Here\u2019s a quick rundown of some dates:\n\n- Due on 18 March 2024? You'll get it on the 19th for Northern Ireland.\n- 19 March? Payment\u2019s on the 20th, Northern Ireland again.\n- Then there's 1 April 2024, which will be paid on the 28 March.\n- And then it keeps going with 6 May, that's gonna be the 3rd, and so on.\n\nYou can always figure out when you'll be paid by checking the site for that. \n\nLastly, if you\u2019re in Scotland or Northern Ireland, watch out for local and public holidays since that might slow down when the bank gives you your money. Just like, ask your bank when you\u2019re actually getting it, 'cause rules can be so confusing, you know? You might have one of those local holidays like Glasgow\u2019s on the 30th of September or something. \n\nSo yeah, that\u2019s pretty much the rundown. Hope that helps!",

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so like, Jobcentre Plus has a bunch of services that can totally help employers, right? You can get stuff like, uh, recruitment advice, and they can help with your job listings and things. They also set you up with these things called work trials, which is like a test run for potential hires. Super cool! And then there's info on work experience and apprenticeships too. If you're thinking about hiring someone with a disability, they can help with that, like the Access to Work thing. \n\nYou can also throw your job ads on the 'Find a job' service, which I think used to be called Universal Jobmatch? Yeah, that\u2019s it. Oh, and this guide is even in Welsh, which is kinda neat.\n\nIf you want advice for, like, hiring people for your biz, just hit up the Employer Services Line. They will hook you up with a local Adviser, who can help you with writing job descriptions and speeding up the hiring process or whatever. They can even promote your jobs at local job centres. \n\nYou can contact them through some online form or just call them up at 0800 169 0178. Oh, and there's also a textphone number if you need it.\n\nSo about those work trials \u2013 they\u2019re basically short gigs you can offer someone who's looking for a job, but they gotta be on benefits. It\u2019s just a way for both of you to see if the job's a fit. If they don\u2019t work out, no biggie, you don\u2019t have to hire them. Just remember, they keep getting their benefits while they do the trial and they don't get paid. \n\nBut there are some rules! The work trial should just be for you to figure out if they\u2019re right for the role you're trying to fill and they can\u2019t be the only one you\u2019re thinking of hiring for that job. Also, it's gotta be for a real job \u2013 like at least 16 hours for 13 weeks or something. \n\nYou better agree on how long the trial is before it starts too, like it shouldn't go longer than 5 days if the job is under like 6 months or something. And it can be longer if the job is for more than 6 months. Jobcentre Plus will make sure everything's good to go.\n\nTo set up a work trial, you just need to talk to Jobcentre Plus first. Easy peasy!  \n\nNow, onto work experience \u2013 that's for pretty much anyone 18 to 24 or people over 25 who haven\u2019t worked in a while. If you're thinking about offering a young person some experience, you can help them, like, get better job chances. You can check out some guidance for what you need to do as an employer.\n\nThen there are apprenticeships! These are usually set up through the Apprenticeship service and they\u2019re like a mix of real work and learning. If you bring on an apprentice, you might get some money to help pay for their training, especially if you're a small biz. Just keep in mind, apprenticeships work a bit differently in places like Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the sector-based work academy programme, which is basically a thing that helps employers with filling job spots better by providing training and stuff. But just a heads up, it's only in England and Scotland.",

      "body": "## Overview \n\nYou can apply for Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) if you have a disability or health condition that affects how much you can work.\n\nESA gives you:\n\n  * money to help with living costs if you\u2019re unable to work\n  * support to get back into work if you\u2019re able to\n\n\n\nYou can apply if you\u2019re employed, self-employed or unemployed.\n\nThis guide is also available [in Welsh (Cymraeg)](/lwfans-cyflogaeth-a-chymorth) and in an [easy read format](/government/publications/easy-read-new-style-employment-and-support-allowance).\n\n## Eligibility \n\nYou can apply for New Style Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) if you\u2019re under [State Pension age](/state-pension-age) and you have a disability or health condition that affects how much you can work.\n\nYou also need to have both:\n\n  * worked as an employee or have been self-employed\n  * paid enough National Insurance contributions, usually in the last 2 to 3 years - [National Insurance credits](/national-insurance-credits) also count\n\n\n\n[Check your National Insurance record](/check-national-insurance-record) for gaps.\n\nYou cannot get New Style ESA if you claim [Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA)](https://www.gov.uk/jobseekers-allowance) or [Statutory Sick Pay](https://www.gov.uk/statutory-sick-pay)\n\n## Claiming Universal Credit and New Style ESA\n\nYou might be able to get [Universal Credit](/universal-credit) at the same time or instead of New Style ESA.\n\nIf you get both benefits, your Universal Credit payment is reduced by the amount you get for New Style ESA.\n\nYour New Style ESA will usually be paid more regularly than Universal Credit. You\u2019ll also get different [National Insurance credits](/national-insurance-credits) which count towards your State Pension and help you qualify for other benefits.\n\n[Check if you\u2019re eligible for Universal Credit](https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/eligibility).\n\n## If your Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) is due to end\n\nYou can apply for New Style ESA up to 3 months before your SSP ends. You\u2019ll start getting New Style ESA as soon as your SSP ends.\n\n## If you\u2019re working\n\nYou can apply whether you\u2019re in or out of work. [There are conditions to working while claiming ESA](/employment-support-allowance/working-while-you-claim).\n\n## What you'll get \n\nHow much you get will depend on what stage your application is at, as well as things like your age and whether you\u2019re able to get back into work.\n\nIf you get New Style ESA you\u2019ll earn Class 1 [National Insurance credits](/national-insurance-credits), which can help towards your State Pension and some benefits in the future.\n\n## What might affect how much you get paid\n\n### If you get New Style ESA\n\nYour payments will be affected if you get more than \u00a385 a week from a private pension. If you do, half of your private pension income over \u00a385 will be subtracted from your ESA payments each week.\n\nFor example, if you get \u00a3100 a week from a private pension, then \u00a37.50 will be subtracted from your ESA payment each week.\n\nIf your private pension income is high enough, you could get no ESA payments. You would still get Class 1 National Insurance credits.\n\n### If you get income-related ESA\n\nYou cannot make a new claim for income-related ESA. You\u2019ll continue to get payments while you\u2019re eligible until your claim ends.\n\nYour household income and savings worth \u00a36,000 or more may affect how much you can get.\n\n## While your claim is being assessed\n\nYou\u2019ll normally get the \u2018assessment rate\u2019 for 13 weeks while your claim is being assessed.\n\nThis will be:\n\n  * up to \u00a371.70 a week if you\u2019re aged under 25\n  * up to \u00a390.50 a week if you\u2019re aged 25 or over\n\n\n\nIf it takes longer than 13 weeks to assess your claim, you\u2019ll continue getting the \u2018assessment rate\u2019 until you get a decision or until your ESA is due to end.\n\nYour ESA will be backdated if you\u2019re owed any money after 13 weeks.\n\n## After you\u2019re assessed\n\nYou\u2019ll be placed into one of 2 groups if you\u2019re entitled to ESA. If you\u2019re able to get back into work in the future, you\u2019ll be put into the work-related activity group. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be put into the support group.\n\nYou\u2019ll get:\n\n  * up to \u00a390.50 a week if you\u2019re in the work-related activity group\n  * up to \u00a3138.20 a week if you\u2019re in the support group\n\n\n\n### If you\u2019re in the support group\n\nIf you\u2019re in the support group and on income-related ESA, you\u2019re also entitled to the enhanced disability premium.\n\nYou may also qualify for the severe disability premium.\n\nFind out how to [apply for a disability premium](/disability-premiums).\n\n## How and when you\u2019re paid\n\nYou\u2019ll get paid ESA every 2 weeks.\n\n[Find out how and when your benefits are paid](/how-to-have-your-benefits-paid).\n\n## Other benefits you can claim\n\nYou could get Universal Credit at the same time or instead of New Style ESA. [Check if you\u2019re eligible for Universal Credit](https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/eligibility).\n\nUse a [benefits calculator](/benefits-calculators) to find out what other benefits you could get, for example Personal Independence Payment (PIP) if you have a long-term health condition or disability.\n\nThe [benefit cap](/benefit-cap) may affect the total amount of benefit you can get. The cap will not affect you if you\u2019re in the support group.\n\n## If you\u2019re moving to Universal Credit from income-related ESA\n\nIf your income-related ESA claim is ending because you\u2019re making a new claim for Universal Credit, you\u2019ll automatically continue to get the amount of ESA you currently receive, as long as you\u2019re still eligible. You\u2019ll normally get this for 2 weeks, starting from the date of your new claim.\n\nThe Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will write to you telling you how this works.\n\nYou do not need to pay this money back, and it will not affect the amount of Universal Credit you get.\n\n## Budgeting Loan\n\nYou can apply for a [Budgeting Loan](/budgeting-help-benefits/eligibility) if you\u2019ve been on income-related ESA for at least 6 months.\n\n## Advice on money and debt\n\nYou can get help and advice from your Jobcentre Plus work coach or:\n\n  * [Citizens Advice](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/)\n  * [Money Helper](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en)\n  * [National Debtline](https://www.nationaldebtline.org/)\n  * [Shelter](https://www.shelter.org.uk/)\n  * [Turn2us](https://www.turn2us.org.uk/)\n\n## Working while you claim \n\nYou can usually work while you are claiming ESA if both of the following apply:\n\n  * you work less than 16 hours a week\n  * you do not earn more than \u00a3183.50 a week\n\n\n\nYou can do as many hours of voluntary work as you like.\n\nTell Jobcentre Plus about your work including any volunteering when you make a claim.\n\nIf you\u2019re already claiming ESA and want to start work, [fill in the ESA permitted work form](/government/publications/employment-and-support-allowance-permitted-work-form). Send the form to Jobcentre Plus.\n\n## How to claim \n\nYou could get Universal Credit at the same time or instead of New Style ESA. [Check if you\u2019re eligible for Universal Credit](/universal-credit/eligibility).\n\nThere\u2019s a different way to [apply in Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/employment-and-support-allowance-people-with-disabilities).\n\n## What you need to apply\n\nYou\u2019ll need:\n\n  * your National Insurance number\n  * your bank or building society account number and sort code (you can use a friend or family member\u2019s account if you do not have one)\n  * your doctor\u2019s name, address and telephone number\n  * a [fit note](/taking-sick-leave) (sometimes called a \u2018sick note\u2019 or a \u2018statement of fitness for work\u2019) if you\u2019ve not been able to work for more than 7 days in a row because of a disability or health condition\n  * details of your income, if you\u2019re working\n  * the date your Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) ends, if you\u2019re claiming it\n\n\n\nYou cannot get New Style ESA if you\u2019re getting Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) from an employer. You can apply for New Style ESA up to 3 months before your SSP ends.\n\n## Apply online for ESA\n\nOnce you\u2019ve applied, you\u2019ll be contacted by phone and told when to give the evidence and where to send it.\n\nYou cannot apply online if you\u2019re applying as [an appointee](/become-appointee-for-someone-claiming-benefits) on someone else\u2019s behalf.\n\n[ Apply now ](https://www.apply-new-style-employment-support-allowance.service.gov.uk/)\n\n## When you can apply by phone\n\nCall the Jobcentre Plus new claims helpline if:\n\n  * you cannot make an application online\n  * you\u2019re an appointee for someone\n\n\n\n### Jobcentre Plus new claims helpline\n\nTelephone: 0800 055 6688  \nTextphone: 0800 328 1344  \n[Relay UK](https://www.relayuk.bt.com) (if you cannot hear or speak on the phone): 18001 then 0800 055 6688  \nBritish Sign Language (BSL) [video relay service](https://connect.interpreterslive.co.uk/vrs?ilc=DWP) if you\u2019re on a computer - find out how to [use the service on mobile or tablet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oELNMfAvDxw)  \nWelsh language telephone: 0800 328 1744  \nMonday to Friday, 8am to 5pm  \n[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)\n\n## After you apply\n\nThe Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will contact you within 10 working days of applying.\n\n### If you\u2019re eligible\n\nDWP will contact you within 10 working days to schedule an appointment that you must attend. It will normally be over the phone with a work coach from your local Jobcentre Plus office. If your appointment is in-person at a Jobcentre Plus office, you\u2019ll need to bring [ID and proof of address](/jobcentre-plus-interview).\n\nYour work coach will explain what you need to do to get New Style ESA. They will create an agreement with you called a \u2018Claimant Commitment\u2019.\n\nYou must agree to your Claimant Commitment before you can get New Style ESA.\n\nAt the appointment, you\u2019ll be asked to:\n\n  * explain how your illness or disability affects your ability to work\n  * provide medical evidence\n  * agree to [tell your local Jobcentre Plus if your circumstances change](/employment-support-allowance/change-of-circumstances)\n\n\n\nIf a medical professional has said you might have 12 months or less to live, you will not need to attend an appointment or make a Claimant Commitment. Find out more about [getting benefits if you\u2019re nearing the end of life](/benefits-end-of-life).\n\n### If you\u2019re not eligible\n\nDWP will send you a letter within 10 working days of applying to explain why you\u2019re not eligible for ESA.\n\n## If you disagree with a decision\n\nYou can [challenge a decision](/mandatory-reconsideration) about your claim. This is called asking for \u2018mandatory reconsideration\u2019.\n\n## Reapplying for ESA\n\nYou cannot make a new claim for income-related ESA. You\u2019ll continue to get payments while you\u2019re eligible until your claim ends.\n\nYou may be able to reapply after your New Style ESA ends. You may qualify again depending on:\n\n  * what National Insurance contributions you paid in the last 2 full tax years before the tax year you\u2019re claiming in\n  * whether you\u2019re placed in the support group because you developed a new condition or your health deteriorated\n\n## Your ESA claim \n\nAfter you\u2019ve made your claim, you\u2019ll be told if you need to have a \u2018Work Capability Assessment\u2019 and what group you\u2019ll be put in.\n\n## Work Capability Assessment\n\nA Work Capability Assessment is used to find out if your illness or disability affects how much you can work.\n\nYou might not need one, for example if you\u2019re in hospital or a medical professional has said you might have 12 months or less to live.\n\nIf you need a Work Capability Assessment you\u2019ll get a letter telling you to fill in the [\u2018Capability for work questionnaire\u2019](/government/publications/capability-for-work-questionnaire) and send it to the Health Assessment Advisory Service. The address is on the form. There is a [different questionnaire in Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/publications/capability-work-questionnaire-esa50).\n\nYou\u2019ll be told what happens next, for example if you need an appointment to understand your health condition better.\n\nIf you\u2019re claiming both Universal Credit and New Style ESA, you\u2019ll only have one Work Capability Assessment.\n\nYou can ask for your assessment to be recorded. If you would like this, tell the Health Assessment Advisory Service using the contact details in your appointment invite letter.\n\n## How the assessment happens\n\nAssessments can be in person, by video call or on the phone. You\u2019ll be told how your assessment will take place.\n\nYou can have someone else with you at the assessment, such as a friend or support worker. If your assessment is by phone or video call, you can ask the assessor to call them if they\u2019re not with you when the assessment starts.\n\nYou\u2019ll stay on the \u2018assessment rate\u2019 until a decision can be made on your Work Capability Assessment.\n\n## After your claim is assessed\n\nIf you\u2019re entitled to ESA you\u2019ll be placed in one of 2 groups:\n\n  * a work-related activity group (you cannot work now, but can prepare to work in the future, for example by writing a CV)\n  * a support group (you cannot work now and you\u2019re not expected to prepare for work in the future)\n\n\n\nYou will:\n\n  * usually be in the support group if your illness or disability severely limits what you can do\n  * be in the support group if a medical professional has said you might have 12 months or less to live\n\n\n\n### If you\u2019re in the work-related activity group\n\nYou must attend regular interviews with a work coach. They can help you improve your skills or write a CV to help you get back into work.\n\n### If you\u2019re in the support group\n\nYou do not have to go to interviews. You can tell your work coach if you\u2019d like to take part in work-related activities.\n\n## How long you\u2019ll get ESA for\n\nYou cannot make a new claim for income-related ESA. You\u2019ll continue to get payments while you\u2019re eligible until your claim ends.\n\nNew Style and contribution-based ESA last for 365 days if you\u2019re in the work-related activity group.\n\nThere\u2019s no time limit if you\u2019re in the support group, or if you\u2019re getting income-related ESA.\n\nTo keep getting ESA you must report any [change in your circumstances](/employment-support-allowance/change-of-circumstances). You may also need to [send fit notes](/send-fit-note) regularly.\n\n## If you get a sanction\n\nYour ESA can be reduced if you do not attend interviews or do work-related activity as agreed with your work coach in your \u2018Claimant Commitment\u2019. This reduction can continue for up to 4 weeks after you restart work-related activities.\n\nYou\u2019ll get a letter to say you may be sanctioned. Tell your work coach if you have a good reason for not doing what was agreed in your Claimant Commitment.\n\nYou\u2019ll get another letter if the decision is made to give you a sanction. Your benefit will only be affected once a decision has been made.\n\nYou should [contact your local council](/find-local-council) immediately if you claim Housing Benefit or Council Tax Reduction. They\u2019ll tell you what to do to continue getting support.\n\nIf you get a sanction you can:\n\n  * [ask for the decision to be looked at again](/appeal-benefit-decision)\n  * ask for a hardship payment\n\n\n\nYou will not get a sanction if you\u2019re in the support group.\n\n## Hardship payments\n\nIf you get income-related ESA, you may be able to get a hardship payment if your benefit has been reduced because of a sanction or a [penalty due to suspected benefit fraud](/benefit-fraud).\n\nA hardship payment is a reduced amount of your ESA. You do not have to pay it back.\n\nYou can get a hardship payment if you cannot pay for rent, heating, food or other basic needs for you or your family. You must be 18 or over.\n\nSpeak to your [Jobcentre Plus adviser](/contact-jobcentre-plus/existing-benefit-claims) or work coach to find out how to claim a hardship payment.\n\n## Report a change of circumstances \n\nYou must report changes to your circumstances so you keep getting the right amount of ESA. The amount you get could go up or down.\n\nYour benefit might be stopped or reduced if you do not report a change straight away.\n\nYou may also need to report changes to other organisations paying you benefits. [Find out how to report a change of circumstances for other benefits](/report-benefits-change-circumstances).\n\n## What you need to report\n\nThis list does not cover every change you must report. Call Jobcentre Plus if you\u2019re not sure whether you need to report a change.\n\nYou may be prosecuted or have to pay a \u00a350 penalty if you give wrong or incomplete information.\n\n### Changes to personal details\n\nYou must report if you:\n\n  * change your bank details\n  * change your telephone number\n  * have someone start or stop living with you\n\n\n\nYou must report if you or anyone who lives with you has a change in immigration status, if you or they are not a British citizen.\n\nYou must report if you, anyone who lives with you, or your husband, wife or civil partner:\n\n  * changes name\n  * changes address\n  * leaves Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) for any period of time\n  * gets married or forms a civil partnership\n  * gets divorced or ends a civil partnership\n  * has a baby or gets pregnant\n  * goes into prison or legal custody\n\n\n\nIf anyone who lives with you or your husband, wife or civil partner dies, report this using the [Tell Us Once service](/after-a-death/organisations-you-need-to-contact-and-tell-us-once) instead.\n\n### Changes to a medical condition or disability\n\nYou must report if you or someone included on your claim:\n\n  * has any changes to a medical condition or disability\n  * goes into hospital, a care home or sheltered accommodation\n  * changes doctor\n  * starts or stops caring for someone\n\n\n\n### Changes to work or education\n\nYou must report if you, anyone who lives with you, or your husband, wife or civil partner:\n\n  * starts or stops education, training or an apprenticeship\n  * finds or leaves a job, or starts working different hours\n  * is involved in a trade dispute, or is unable to work because of a trade dispute (for example, if there\u2019s a strike)\n\n\n\n### Changes to income and benefits\n\nYou must report if you or anyone who lives with you:\n\n  * has a change to their salary or earnings from work\n  * gets paid back-pay (sometimes called \u2018arrears\u2019) for their salary or earnings from work\n  * starts or stops getting a benefit or a pension\n  * starts or stops getting any other regular source of money (for example, student loans or grants, sick pay, or money from a charity)\n  * has a change to the amount of money they get from a benefit, a pension or any other regular source of money\n\n\n\nYou must also report if anyone caring for you starts or stops getting:\n\n  * Carer\u2019s Allowance\n  * Carer Support Payment\n  * the carer element of Universal Credit\n\n\n\n### Changes to assets\n\nAssets are things like:\n\n  * savings or investments\n  * property\n  * one-off payments (for example, money from inheritance or a lump sum payment)\n\n\n\nYou must report if you and anyone who lives with you starts or stops having \u00a36,000 or more in total assets between you.\n\nIf you already have over \u00a36,000 in total assets between you, you must report any increase or decrease to the value of those assets.\n\n## If you\u2019ve been paid too much\n\nIf you give wrong or incomplete information or do not report a change straight away, you might be paid too much.

      "poorly_written_article": "So, if you have a disability or health issue that makes it hard to work, you can apply for something called Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). It's like this support thing that gives you money for living costs if you can\u2019t work. And hey, if you\u2019re able to work a bit, they might help you get back into the job market too. You can apply whether you're working, self-employed, or just chilling at home. Also, there's a Welsh version and an easy read version too, if you need that.\n\n### Who Can Apply?\n\nOkay, so to get the fancy New Style ESA, you gotta be under the State Pension age and have some kind of health problem that messes with your ability to work. You need to have worked before too, like as an employee or been self-employed at some point. And yeah, you gotta pay National Insurance stuff - usually from the last couple of years or getting credits works too. Just check your National Insurance record for any gaps, you know?  \n\nYou can't get New Style ESA though if you're already claiming other things like Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) or Statutory Sick Pay (SSP). So keep that in mind.\n\n### About Universal Credit and ESA\n\nYou might be able to grab Universal Credit while getting New Style ESA at the same time. If you do, your Universal Credit will be a bit less because of the ESA you're getting. Usually, you get the ESA payments more often than Universal Credit stuff, and you also get different National Insurance credits that might help your pension or other benefits later.\n\n### What If Your SSP is Ending?\n\nIf your Statutory Sick Pay is about to end, you can actually apply for New Style ESA up to 3 months beforehand, which is kind of neat. You\u2019d start getting ESA as soon as the SSP finishes, I think.\n\n### If You\u2019re Working\n\nYou can apply for ESA even if you have a job \u2013 just remember, there are rules about how much you can work while also getting ESA. \n\n### How Much You Get\n\nNow, how much you get depends on a bunch of stuff like your age and where you\u2019re at in the application process. If you get ESA, you\u2019ll also get some National Insurance credits, which is good for your State Pension and other benefits later on.\n\n### What Affects Payment Amount?\n\nSo, if you\u2019re getting New Style ESA, just know that if you make over \u00a385 a week from a private pension, they will take half of what\u2019s above that out of your ESA payments. Like, if you get \u00a3100 a week from a pension, they'll take \u00a37.50 off your ESA.\n\nBut if that private pension money is high enough, you might not get any ESA at all, but you would still get the National Insurance credits, which is something at least.  \n\nIf you\u2019re getting income-related ESA, you can\u2019t claim for it again, but you\u2019ll keep getting it until your situation changes. Just be careful with your household income because having savings over \u00a36,000 could affect what you get.\n\n### While Your Claim is Being Looked At\n\nYou\u2019ll usually get something called the \u2018assessment rate\u2019 for 13 weeks while they look at your claim. This means:\n- Up to \u00a371.70 a week if you\u2019re under 25\n- Up to \u00a390.50 a week if you\u2019re older than that.\n\nIf they take longer than 13 weeks to decide, you keep getting that assessment amount until they get back to you or until your ESA runs out. And just so you know, if you find out you\u2019re owed money later on, it can be backdated.\n\n### After the Assessment\n\nOnce they\u2019ve checked your info, you\u2019ll be put in one of two groups. If you might be able to work down the line, they\u2019ll toss you into the work-related activity group. Or, if you can\u2019t, you could find yourself in the support group. In the work-related group, you\u2019ll get up to \u00a390.50 a week, and in the support group, it\u2019s up to \u00a3138.20 a week.\n\n### When You Get Paid\n\nYou get your ESA every two weeks, just so you know. And you might also want to check what other benefits you're able to snag while getting ESA, like maybe Universal Credit or Personal Independence Payment (PIP) if you have ongoing health issues. \n\n### Reporting Changes\n\nYou gotta report any changes in your situation. If you don\u2019t, there might be problems and you could end up getting less money. You might even need to pay some back if they find out you got too much.Changes to personal details like moving or changes in health should definitely be reported. They don\u2019t cover everything here, but if you\u2019re unsure, just call Jobcentre Plus. Don\u2019t let it get messy, you know?\n\n### If You Get Paid Too Much\n\nIf you mess up reporting something and end up getting too much money, you could be in trouble and might have to pay some of that back, which is a bummer.\n\n### Wrap It Up\n\nSo yeah, if you want to apply, fill in your details, and make sure you're all set with the necessary info like your National Insurance number and bank details. Then they\u2019ll call you up to get some more info and direct you where to send everything. Good luck with it!",

If you're kinda struggling with cash and need help covering expenses, you can, like, apply for Universal Credit instead, right? Oh, and there's a Welsh version of this guide, so if that's your thing, go for it! \n\nIf you are already getting Income Support, that\u2019s cool. You\u2019ll keep getting it as long as you check off all these things:\n\n- You\u2019re broke, or have a low income and not more than \u00a316,000 saved.\n- Not working full-time (you can work a little, like 16 hours a week, and if you have a partner, they can work less than 24 hours).\n- Between 16 years old and the Pension Credit age\u2014look that up.\n- Living in England, Scotland, or Wales, 'cause Northern Ireland has its own rules (weird, I know).\n\nYou also have to be one of these:\n- Pregnant\n- A single parent (like, solo, and your kid is under 5)\n- A lone foster parent with a kid under 16 \n- Or a bunch of other stuff that means you can\u2019t really work\u2014like maternity leave or you\u2019re sick or whatever.\n- Or you might be in school, but not, like, uni, and have a kid.\n- Oh, and refugees who are learning English can apply too, as long as they\u2019re taking a course that\u2019s like, at least 15 hours a week. \n\nEven if you don't have a permanent place to crash, like, if you\u2019re homeless or in a hostel, you can still claim.\n\nOh, and remember to tell them if something changes! Like if you move or get a new phone\u2014don\u2019t forget that because they can stop or reduce your claim if you keep it to yourself. Also, if you give some wrong info, you could end up in trouble or fined. \n\nIf you\u2019re switching to Universal Credit \u2018cause your Income Support's ending, no worries\u2014you keep getting the same amount for a couple weeks. The DWP will send you a letter explaining it\u2014real nice of them! \n\nNow, if you disagree with any decision they make, yeah, you can challenge that. Just, um, it\u2019s called mandatory reconsideration, which sounds so official and stuff.\n\nYou also gotta report any personal changes. Like if you switch bank accounts or someone moves in or out. And you definitely need to tell them if, heaven forbid, your partner or someone you live with passes away.\n\nFor health stuff, tell them if someone in your household gets better or worse, like about a disability, or if they go into the hospital or something. \n\nIf school, training, or jobs change, you have to let them know too. Same with any cash flow changes\u2014like if you get a pay rise or any extra money. Or if you hit over \u00a36,000 in savings, definitely tell them! \n\nTo report changes, you just call them up or write a letter\u2014easy peasy. \n\nOh, and if you end up with too much money 'cause you didn\u2019t report soon enough, you might have to pay it back, yikes!  \n\nAbout the payments, they usually send the cash every two weeks into your bank or wherever. They have a basic payment and premiums based on your sitch, and like, the rates vary for different ages and situations,  so check that out. \n\nSo yeah, that\u2019s it in a nutshell. Don\u2019t forget to stay on top of your reports and all that jazz, and good luck with your claims, or whatever!",

It applies to most people aged 16 or over who have not reached [State Pension age](/state-pension-age).\n\nThis guide is also available [in Welsh (Cymraeg)](/cap-ar-fudd-daliadau).\n\nThe benefit cap affects:\n\n  * Universal Credit\n  * Bereavement Allowance\n  * Child Benefit\n  * Child Tax Credit\n  * Employment and Support Allowance\n  * Housing Benefit\n  * Incapacity Benefit\n  * Income Support\n  * Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance\n  * Maternity Allowance\n  * Severe Disablement Allowance\n  * Widowed Parent\u2019s Allowance (or Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance or Widow\u2019s Pension if you started getting it before 9 April 2001)\n\n\n\nYou might [not be affected by the benefit cap](/benefit-cap/when-youre-not-affected) if you get certain benefits or you\u2019re over State Pension age.\n\nIf you\u2019re claiming Universal Credit the [benefit cap might not start for 9 months](/benefit-cap/how-earnings-affect-when-benefit-cap-starts), depending on your earnings.\n\n## When you're not affected \n\nYou\u2019re not affected by the cap if you\u2019re over [State Pension age](/state-pension-age). If you\u2019re part of a couple and one of you is under State Pension age, the cap may apply.\n\nYou\u2019re not affected by the cap if you or your partner:\n\n  * get [Working Tax Credit](https://www.gov.uk/working-tax-credit/eligibility) (even if the amount you get is \u00a30)\n  * get Universal Credit because of a disability or health condition that stops you from working (this is called \u2018limited capability for work and work-related activity\u2019)\n  * get Universal Credit because you care for someone with a disability\n  * get Universal Credit and you and your partner earn \u00a3793 or more a month combined, after tax and National Insurance contributions\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re also not affected by the cap if you, your partner or any children under 18 living with you gets:\n\n  * Adult Disability Payment (ADP)\n  * Armed Forces Compensation Scheme\n  * Armed Forces Independence Payment\n  * Attendance Allowance\n  * Carer\u2019s Allowance\n  * Carer Support Payment\n  * Child Disability Payment\n  * Disability Living Allowance (DLA)\n  * Employment and Support Allowance (if you get the support component)\n  * Guardian\u2019s Allowance\n  * Industrial Injuries Benefits (and equivalent payments as part of a War Disablement Pension or the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme)\n  * Pension Age Disability Payment\n  * Personal Independence Payment (PIP)\n  * War pensions\n  * War Widow\u2019s or War Widower\u2019s Pension\n\n\n\nIf you are affected, the [benefit cap might not start for 9 months](/benefit-cap/how-earnings-affect-when-benefit-cap-starts) \\- depending on your earnings.\n\n## When the benefit cap affects your Universal Credit payments \n\nThe benefit cap might not affect your Universal Credit payments for up to 9 months. This is called the \u2018grace period\u2019.\n\nYou\u2019ll get the grace period if all of the following are true:\n\n  * you\u2019re claiming Universal Credit because you stopped working or your earnings went down\n  * you\u2019re now earning less than \u00a3793 a month\n  * in each of the 12 months before your earnings went down or you stopped working, you earned the same as or more than the earnings threshold (this was \u00a3722 up to 7 April 2024 and is \u00a3793 from 8 April 2024)\n\n\n\nYour partner\u2019s earnings will be included when working out how much you earned even if they\u2019re not claiming benefits. If you have separated from your partner, their earnings will be included for the time that you lived with them before you separated.\n\nYou need to report your last 12 months\u2019 earnings when you [apply for Universal Credit](/universal-credit/how-to-claim) to get the grace period.\n\nYou will [not be affected by the benefit cap](/benefit-cap/when-youre-not-affected) if you or your partner get Universal Credit because you have a disability or health condition or because you care for someone with a disability or you earn \u00a3793 or more between you.\n\n## How the 9 month grace period works\n\nIf you\u2019re already claiming Universal Credit, the grace period will start on the first day of the assessment period in which your earnings went below the earnings threshold. The threshold was \u00a3722 up to 7 April 2024 and is \u00a3793 from 8 April 2024.\n\nIf you\u2019re making a new claim for Universal Credit, the grace period starts from either:\n\n  * the day after the last day you worked\n  * the payday when your earnings went below the earnings threshold (this was \u00a3722 up to 7 April 2024 and is \u00a3793 from 8 April 2024)\n\n\n\nThe 9 month grace period continues if you stop claiming Universal Credit and then start again.\n\nExample\n\nYour 9 month grace period starts on 1 February.\n\nYou get a job on 1 May and your benefit stops. You stop work and claim again from 1 August.\n\nYour 9 month grace period will end on 31 October.\n\nAfter the 9 month grace period ends, the amount of Universal Credit you get will usually go down. It might not go down if your circumstances change and you are [not affected by the benefit cap](/benefit-cap/when-youre-not-affected).\n\n## Help if you're affected by the benefit cap \n\nContact the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) if you\u2019re affected by the benefit cap and you need help.\n\nIf you need help paying your rent or a rent deposit, contact your [local council](/find-local-council) as well. They can check if you\u2019re eligible for a [discretionary housing payment](/government/publications/claiming-discretionary-housing-payments/claiming-discretionary-housing-payments), which is not affected by the benefit cap.\n\n## If you get Universal Credit\n\nContact DWP either:\n\n  * through the journal in your [online account](/sign-in-universal-credit)\n  * by calling the [Universal Credit helpline](/universal-credit/contact-universal-credit)\n\n\n\n## If you get any other benefits\n\nBenefit cap helpline if you do not get Universal Credit  \nTelephone: 0800 169 0145   \nTelephone (Welsh): 0800 169 0238  \nTextphone: 0800 169 0314   \n[Relay UK](https://www.relayuk.bt.com/) (if you cannot hear or speak on the phone): 18001 then 0800 169 0145  \nBritish Sign Language (BSL) [video relay service](https://connect.interpreterslive.co.uk/vrs?ilc=DWP) if you\u2019re on a computer - find out how to [use the service on mobile or tablet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oELNMfAvDxw)\n\nMonday to Friday, 8am to 6pm   \n[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)\n\n## Benefit cap amounts \n\nThe amount you get through the benefit cap depends on whether:\n\n  * you live inside or outside [Greater London](http://directory.londoncouncils.gov.uk)\n  * you\u2019re single or in a couple\n  * your children live with you (if you\u2019re single)\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re in a couple but you do not live together, you\u2019ll get the amounts for a single person.\n\n## Benefit cap outside Greater London\n\n| Per week | Per month  \n---|---|---  \nIf you\u2019re in a couple | \u00a3423.46 | \u00a31,835  \nIf you\u2019re a single parent and your children live with you | \u00a3423.46 | \u00a31,835  \nIf you\u2019re a single adult | \u00a3283.71 | \u00a31,229.42  \n  \n## Benefit cap inside Greater London\n\n| Per week | Per month  \n---|---|---  \nIf you\u2019re in a couple | \u00a3486.98 | \u00a32,110.25  \nIf you\u2019re a single parent and your children live with you | \u00a3486.98 | \u00a32,110.25  \nIf you\u2019re a single adult | \u00a3326.29 | \u00a31,413.92\n  *[DWP]: Department for Work and Pensions",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, there's this thing called the benefit cap, which is kinda like a limit on how much money you can get from benefits. It's for folks who are 16 and over but not old enough for the State Pension, whatever that is. \n\nYou can get more info in Welsh, but, I mean, if you don\u2019t speak it, good luck with that, right? Anyway, this cap messes with a bunch of benefits like Universal Credit, Child Benefit, and some other ones nobody really wants to think about like Incapacity Benefit and some allowances for widows or whatever.\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky and getting certain benefits or you\u2019re over State Pension age, then you might not have to worry about the cap at all. And if you\u2019re claiming Universal Credit, you might not fall under the cap for about 9 months depending on how much money you\u2019re earning, which is kinda a big relief if you need it.\n\nOkay, so here's when you're totally off the hook. If you or your partner is over State Pension age, you're safe from the cap. But if one of you is under that age, then watch out because the cap might still hit you. \n\nAlso, you\u2019re in the clear if either you or your partner are on Working Tax Credit, or if Universal Credit covers your disability or health issues \u2013 that\u2019s the stuff that stops you from working. Oh, and if you make over like \u00a3793 a month combined after taxes, you can breathe easy too.\n\nIn fact, if you or your kids under 18 are getting several payments like Disability Living Allowance (DLA) or Attendance Allowance, then forget about the cap! But if you're affected by it, be ready for what\u2019s next - because the cap could kick in at some point after 9 months, depending on how much cash you bring in.\n\nSo there's this thing called a grace period, which is like a breathing space where your Universal Credit might not be affected by the cap for up to 9 months. To get this grace period, you really need to have been earning pretty decent before you hit a rough patch. Basically, if you earned more than the earnings threshold \u2013 which, by the way, was \u00a3722 until April \u201924 and bumps up to \u00a3793 after \u2014 then you\u2019re golden.\n\nIf you're already getting Universal Credit and your earnings drop below that threshold, your grace period starts on the first day of that assessment period when you dropped below it. Or, if you just started making a new claim, it begins the day after your last job or the payday when your earnings dropped below that cap amount.\n\nSo, get this, if you\u2019re in this weird spot where you're going in and out of Universal Credit, like you quit your job and then grab a new one, your grace period still counts! \n\nOnce that 9 months is done, your Universal Credit might go down unless you\u2019re still one of the lucky ones who get specific benefits. Because, surprise surprise, the cap affects how much cash you see!\n\nIf you're dealing with the cap and freaking out, hit up the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) ASAP. They can sorta help you figure things out, especially if rent's becoming a nightmare. Just know local councils might help out too with rent deposits.\n\nFor folks on Universal Credit, hit them up through their online journal or call their help line. Pretty simple. But if you're on other benefits and not Universal Credit, there\u2019s a specific helpline to dial into, which honestly, good luck remembering those numbers, right?\n\nAnd lastly, the benefit cap amount depends on whether you live in London or not and if you\u2019re single or in a couple. Seriously, it gets a bit complicated, but if you\u2019re in a couple and living together, you\u2019ll get more than if you\u2019re single or living apart but, like, you know, it\u2019s not super hard to figure out.\n\nSo, for caps outside London, if you're a couple, it\u2019s like \u00a3423 a week or \u00a31,835 a month, while a single adult gets \u00a3283.71 a week or \u00a31,229.42 monthly. Inside London, it\u2019s a bit higher \u2013 couples get \u00a3486.98 weekly or over \u00a32,110 a month. Just makes living there super fun, right? Anyway, that's about it on the benefit cap; hope that helps or something!",

If you or your partner gets Pension Credit, this will also stop if one of you claims Universal Credit.\n\nYou\u2019ll continue getting any other benefits you already receive, such as Personal Independence Payment (PIP) or Carer\u2019s Allowance.\n\nYou can read more about [how tax credits and Universal Credit affect each other](/how-tax-credits-affect-other-benefits).\n\nIf you get [certain other benefits at the same time as Universal Credit](/universal-credit/what-youll-get), the amount of Universal Credit you receive will be reduced.\n\n## Eligibility \n\nYou may be able to get Universal Credit if you\u2019re on a low income or need help with your living costs.

You must make a joint claim for your household, even if your partner is not eligible. How much you can get will depend on your partner\u2019s income and savings, as well as your own.\n\n### If one of you has reached State Pension age\n\nIf only one of you has reached [State Pension age](/calculate-state-pension), you and your partner can still claim Universal Credit as a couple. Your Universal Credit claim will stop when you both reach State Pension age.\n\nIf you\u2019re getting Pension Credit, it will stop if you or your partner make a claim for Universal Credit.

You would get the extra amount until the 31 August after their:\n\n  * 16th birthday\n  * 19th birthday, if they\u2019re in eligible education or training \u2013 for example, they\u2019re studying for GCSEs, A levels, BTECs, Scottish Highers and SVQs or NVQs up to level 3\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll only get an extra amount for your first and second child. You will not get an extra amount for any more children unless:\n\n  * your children were born before 6 April 2017\n  * you were already claiming for 3 or more children before 6 April 2017\n  * other [exceptions apply](/guidance/universal-credit-and-families-with-more-than-2-children-information-for-claimants)\n\n\n\n### If your child has a disability\n\nYou might get an extra monthly amount if any of your children are disabled. You\u2019ll get this extra amount no matter how many children you have. \n\nYou\u2019ll get:\n\n  * \u00a3156.11 if you get the lower rate\n\n  * \u00a3487.58 if you get the higher rate\n\n\n\n\nThe amount you get depends on the [benefits your child receives and whether they have specific disabilities](/government/publications/universal-credit-and-your-family-quick-guide/universal-credit-further-information-for-families#support-for-disabled-children).\n\n### Childcare costs\n\nYou can claim back up to 85% of your childcare costs if you\u2019re working. If you live with your partner both of you need to be working, unless one of you is unable to work due to a disability or health condition.\n\nThe childcare needs to be from a registered provider.

Another \u00a34.35 is taken off for any remaining amount that is not a complete \u00a3250.\n\nFind out more about [money taken off your Universal Credit payment](/guidance/find-out-about-money-taken-off-your-universal-credit-payment).\n\n### Benefits that affect how much Universal Credit you get\n\nYou can get Universal Credit at the same time as other benefits. Your Universal Credit payment will be reduced by an amount equal to the other benefit\u2019s payment. This applies when you get Universal Credit and any of the following benefits:\n\n  * Armed Forces Pensions\n  * Carer\u2019s Allowance\n  * Carer Support Payment (Scotland)\n  * Incapacity Benefit\n  * Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit (excluding any increases where constant attendance is needed and for exceptionally severe disablement)\n  * Maternity Allowance\n  * New Style Employment and Support Allowance\n  * New Style Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance\n  * Severe Disablement Allowance\n  * State Pension\n  * Widowed Mother\u2019s Allowance\n  * Widowed Parent\u2019s Allowance\n\n\n\n## Moving to Universal Credit from other benefits\n\nIf you\u2019ve applied for Universal Credit, you\u2019ll keep getting your current benefit paid for 2 more weeks.

Find out more about [Universal Credit reviews](/universal-credit-reviews).\n\n## How your wages affect your payments \n\nIf you or your partner are working, how much Universal Credit you get will depend on how much you earn. There\u2019s no limit to how many hours you can work and still get Universal Credit.\n\nIf your wages go up, your Universal Credit payment will reduce. If you stop working or your wages go down, your payment will increase.\n\nThere are different rules [if you\u2019re self-employed](/self-employment-and-universal-credit).\n\nFor every \u00a31 you earn from working, your Universal Credit payment goes down by 55p. Your income will be your wages plus your new Universal Credit payment.\n\nUse a [benefits calculator](/benefits-calculators) to see how your Universal Credit changes if your wages go up.\n\nMost employers will report your wages for you. You will normally only need to report monthly earnings if you\u2019re self-employed.\n\n## If you have a disability, health condition or have children\n\nYou can earn a certain amount before your Universal Credit starts to be reduced if you or your partner are either:\n\n  * responsible for a child or young person\n  * living with a [disability or health condition](/health-conditions-disability-universal-credit) that affects your ability to work\n\n\n\nThis amount is called a \u2018work allowance\u2019. How much you can earn before your Universal Credit payment is reduced depends on whether you get housing costs.\n\nIf you get help with housing costs, your payment will start to reduce when your monthly wages reach \u00a3404.\n\nIf you do not get help with housing costs, your payment will start to reduce when your monthly wages reach \u00a3673.\n\n## How often and how much you\u2019re paid\n\nThe amount of Universal Credit you get is calculated each month. This is called your \u2018[monthly assessment period](/universal-credit/how-youre-paid).\u2019\n\nYour Universal Credit amount should stay the same if your:\n\n  * employer pays you the same amount each month\n  * employer pays you on the same date\n  * personal circumstances do not change\n\n\n\nYour Universal Credit amount will be affected if you:\n\n  * do not get paid during a monthly assessment period\n  * get paid more than once in a monthly assessment period\n  * earn a different amount in each monthly assessment period\n\n\n\nYou can check how much Universal Credit you\u2019ll be paid by signing in to your online account.\n\nRead more about [Universal Credit and earnings](/guidance/universal-credit-and-earnings).\n\n## If your Universal Credit payment stops because your wages increased\n\nAs you or your partner\u2019s wages increase, your Universal Credit payments will reduce until you\u2019re earning enough to no longer get Universal Credit. Your payments will then be stopped. You\u2019ll be told when this happens.\n\nIf your wages decrease after this, you could become eligible for Universal Credit again.\n\nIf it\u2019s been 6 months or less since your last Universal Credit payment, you\u2019ll automatically start getting payments again. If it\u2019s been more than 6 months, you\u2019ll need to reapply for Universal Credit.\n\n## How you're paid \n\nUniversal Credit is paid once a month, usually into your bank, building society or credit union account.\n\nYour payment can include [money for your rent](https://www.gov.uk/housing-and-universal-credit) or other housing costs. You\u2019ll usually need to pay this to your landlord.\n\nIf you\u2019re not able to open a bank, building society or credit union account, [call the Universal Credit helpline](/universal-credit/contact-universal-credit) to arrange a different way of getting paid.\n\nFind out how you\u2019ll be paid if [you\u2019re in Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/how-and-when-you-get-paid-universal-credit).\n\n## Your first payment\n\nIt usually takes around 5 weeks to get your first payment. If you need money while you wait for your first payment, you can [apply for an advance](/universal-credit/get-an-advance-first-payment).\n\n## Your monthly assessment periods\n\nUniversal Credit is [calculated based on your circumstances](/universal-credit/what-youll-get) each month. These are called your \u2018assessment periods\u2019. You\u2019ll usually get your Universal Credit payment 7 days after each monthly assessment period ends.\n\n[Changes in your circumstances](/universal-credit/changes-of-circumstances) can affect how much you\u2019re paid for your assessment period. You should report a change of circumstances to get the correct payment.\n\nYour first assessment period starts the day you make a claim.\n\n### Example\n\nSam makes a new Universal Credit claim on 10 September.\n\nSam\u2019s first assessment period runs for one month to 9 October, with a new assessment period beginning on 10 October.\n\nThey get paid on 17 October and then on the 17th of each month after that.\u200b\n\n## Payment dates\n\nAfter the first payment, you\u2019ll be paid on the same date of every month.\n\nIf your payment date is on a weekend or a bank holiday, you\u2019ll be paid on the working day before.\n\nYou can see your monthly statement in your online account. This tells you how much Universal Credit you\u2019re going to get.\n\n### If you live in Scotland\n\nYou can get paid once or twice a month.\n\nIf you\u2019re making a new claim, you\u2019ll get a notification about how often you want to be paid. You get this after your first payment.\n\nIf you\u2019re already getting Universal Credit and have not had a notification, you can ask your work coach if you can be paid twice a month.\n\nWhen you\u2019re paid twice a month your first payment will be for a full month. You\u2019ll get the first half of your second month\u2019s payment a month after this. The second half will be paid 15 days later. This means there will be about a month and a half between your first payment and the full amount for your second month.\n\nAfter this, you\u2019ll be paid twice a month.\n\n#### Example\n\nYou get your first payment on 14 December. This payment is for a full month.\n\nIf you\u2019re paid twice a month, you get half of your second payment on 14 January and the other half on 29 January.\n\nYou get paid on the 14th and 29th of each month after that.\n\n## If you live with a partner\n\nIf you both claim Universal Credit, you\u2019ll get one payment each month for your household.\n\nIf you live in Scotland and you\u2019ve chosen to be paid twice monthly, you\u2019ll receive 2 payments each month for your household.\n\n[Call the Universal Credit helpline](/universal-credit/contact-universal-credit) if you\u2019re worried about getting access to this money.\n\n## Ask to change how you\u2019re paid\n\nYou can ask to have your Universal Credit paid differently if you need help managing a single monthly payment. This is called an [Alternative Payment Arrangement (APA)](/government/publications/universal-credit-alternative-payment-arrangements). Having an APA could mean:\n\n  * your rent is paid directly to your landlord\n  * you receive payments twice a month instead of once a month\n  * you arrange to get a separate payment from your partner\n\n\n\nYou should contact Universal Credit after you\u2019ve made a claim to ask for an APA. They\u2019ll decide whether you should have an APA based on your circumstances.\n\nYou\u2019re more likely to get an APA if you have things like:\n\n  * unpaid rent (also known as being in \u2018rent arrears\u2019)\n  * addiction problems\n  * mental health issues\n  * learning difficulties\n  * experience of homelessness\n  * experience of domestic abuse\n\n## How to claim \n\nYou can apply for Universal Credit online.\n\nYou need to create an account to make a claim. You must complete your claim within 28 days of creating your account or you will have to start again. Your claim starts on the date you submit it in your account.\n\nIf you live with your partner, you will both need to create accounts. You\u2019ll link them together when you claim. You cannot claim by yourself.\n\nIf you cannot claim online, you can claim by phone through the Universal Credit helpline.\n\n## Check if you\u2019re better off on Universal Credit before you apply\n\nIf you already get benefits or tax credits, you should work out if you\u2019ll be better off before you or your partner claim Universal Credit.\n\nIf you apply for Universal Credit those benefits might end and you will not be able to apply for them again, even if your application is not approved.\n\nTo check if you\u2019re better off, you can:\n\n  * use a [benefits calculator](/benefits-calculators)\n\n  * contact [the Citizens Advice Help to Claim service](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/about-us/contact-us/contact-us/help-to-claim/)\n\n  * ask a [local benefits adviser](https://advicelocal.uk/find-an-adviser)\n\n\n\n\n## What you need to apply\n\nTo apply online you\u2019ll need:\n\n  * your bank, building society or credit union account details\n  * an email address\n  * access to a phone\n\n\n\nIf you do not have these, you can call the Universal Credit helpline or go to a jobcentre. You can also get support from the Citizens Advice Help to Claim service.\n\nYou\u2019ll also have to prove your identity. You\u2019ll need some identity documents for this, for example your:\n\n  * driving licence\n  * passport\n  * debit or credit card\n  * payslip or P60\n\n\n\nTo complete your claim you will need to provide information about:\n\n  * [your housing](/housing-and-universal-credit), for example how much rent you pay\n  * your earnings, for example payslips\n  * your [National Insurance number](/national-insurance/your-national-insurance-number), if you have one\n  * other benefits you get\n  * any disability or health condition that affects your work\n  * how much you pay for childcare if you want help with childcare costs\n  * your [savings and any investments](/guidance/universal-credit-money-savings-and-investments), like shares or a property that you rent out\n\n\n\nYou might need an appointment with the Universal Credit team if:\n\n  * they need more information\n  * you cannot verify your identity online\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll be told if this appointment will be in a jobcentre or on the phone.\n\nYou will have to go to a meeting to agree the activities in [your claimant commitment](/universal-credit/your-claimant-commitment) before you can get your first payment.\n\n## Apply for Universal Credit online\n\n[ Apply now ](https://www.universal-credit.service.gov.uk/postcode-checker)\n\n### Help with your claim\n\nThere are 2 ways to get help with your Universal Credit claim.

You start paying it back out of your first payment.\n\n### Example\n\nYour first estimated payment is \u00a3344 and you get \u00a3344 as an advance.\n\nYou pay back your advance over 24 months, which is \u00a314.33 per month. You\u2019ll get \u00a3329.67 on your first payment date - this is your first payment minus the bit you\u2019re repaying (\u00a3344 minus \u00a314.33).\n\nRead more about [getting a Universal Credit advance](/guidance/universal-credit-advances).\n\n## Your claimant commitment \n\nTo get Universal Credit payments, you\u2019ll need to accept an agreement called a \u2018claimant commitment\u2019.\n\nThis is a record of what you agree to do to:\n\n  * prepare for and look for work\n  * increase your earnings, if you are already working.\n\n\n\nIf you live with your partner, you both have to claim Universal Credit. You\u2019ll each have your own claimant commitment.\n\nYou must do everything you agree to in your commitment or your payment could be reduced or stopped. This is called a sanction.\n\nIf a medical professional has said you might have 12 months or less to live, you will not need a claimant commitment and you will not get a sanction.\n\n## Agreeing your commitments\n\nYou will have a meeting to discuss your claimant commitment, usually at the jobcentre. In this meeting you\u2019ll discuss your circumstances and talk about anything that could make it hard for you to do what\u2019s in your commitment. For example, if you have a mental health condition, or if you care for someone.\n\nYou must accept your claimant commitment in your online account or your Universal Credit claim will be stopped.\n\nYour claimant commitment is reviewed regularly and will change if your circumstances change. For example, if you get ill, your partner starts a job or you have a child.\n\n## If you need to look for work\n\nYou might need to look for a job. If you have a job, you might need to look for a better paid job or try to work more hours.\n\nWhat you need to do depends on if you:\n\n  * have a health condition or are disabled\n  * care for someone\n  * have a child under 13\n  * earn above a certain amount (the [\u2018administrative earnings threshold\u2019](/guidance/universal-credit-and-earnings#earnings-and-your-responsibilities))\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re not able to work now but you will be able to in the future, you might need to prepare for work. This could include things like writing a CV or attending a training course.\n\n### Your work coach\n\nIf you need to look for work, you will get help from a \u2018work coach\u2019. Your work coach can help with things like applying for jobs, accessing training or looking for work in your area.\n\n## Attending appointments\n\nYou may need to attend regular appointments. These are usually in the jobcentre, but could also be by phone.\n\nIf you miss an appointment, you\u2019ll need to provide a good reason for not attending. If your reason is not accepted, you could get a sanction and your Universal Credit payment will be reduced.\n\n## Managing your claim online\n\nYou will have to manage your claim in your online account. You might have to reply to messages, record your childcare costs, or tell us what you\u2019ve done to look for work.\n\nYou\u2019ll get a text or email when you need to do something in your online account.\n\nYou will also have to [report changes in your circumstances](/universal-credit/changes-of-circumstances).\n\n## Get help and support\n\nYou should [contact the Universal Credit helpline](/universal-credit/contact-universal-credit) for support straight away if you:\n\n  * are unable to manage your claim online and need to claim by phone\n  * cannot do the things you\u2019ve agreed to in your claimant commitment\n  * are unable to respond to a message or do something you\u2019re asked to in your online account\n  * will miss an appointment\n\n\n\nYou may be able to get a short pause or change to your claimant commitment in an emergency. For example, if you have a death in the family or are at risk of homelessness.\n\n## Help if your payment is stopped or reduced\n\nIf you do not do what is in your claimant commitment, you could get a sanction.\n\nIf you cannot pay for your rent, heating, food or hygiene needs because you got a sanction, you can [ask Universal Credit for a hardship payment](/guidance/universal-credit-recoverable-hardship-payments-rhps).\n\n## Report a change of circumstances \n\nYou need to report changes to your circumstances so you keep getting the right amount each month.\n\nYou need to report changes as soon as they happen. Any delay may mean you receive too much money and will have to make a repayment.\n\nChanges in your circumstances can affect how much you\u2019re paid for your whole assessment period - not just from the date you report them.\n\nChanges can include:\n\n  * finding or finishing a job\n  * having a child\n  * moving in with your partner\n  * starting to care for a child or disabled person\n  * your child stopping or restarting education or training, if they\u2019re aged 16 to 19\n  * changing your mobile number or email address\n  * moving to a new address\n  * going outside Great Britain for any length of time, if you live there\n  * going outside Northern Ireland for any length of time, if you live there\n  * changing your bank details\n  * your rent going up or down\n  * changes to your health condition\n  * becoming too ill to work or meet your work coach\n  * changes to your earnings (only if you\u2019re self-employed)\n  * changes to your [savings, investments and how much money you have](/guidance/universal-credit-money-savings-and-investments)\n  * changes to your immigration status, if you\u2019re not a British citizen\n\n\n\nYou could be taken to court or have to pay a penalty if you give wrong information or do not report a change in your circumstances.\n\n## How to report\n\nYou can report a change of circumstances by [signing in to your Universal Credit account](/sign-in-universal-credit).\n\n## If you get a job or increase the hours you work\n\nUse a [benefits calculator](/benefits-calculators) or speak with your work coach to find out how getting a job or an increase in your earnings might affect your Universal Credit claim.\n\nMost employers will report your earnings for you. You will normally only need to report monthly earnings if you are self-employed.\n\n## If you\u2019ve been paid too much\n\nYou may have to repay the money if you:\n\n  * did not report a change straight away\n  * gave wrong information\n  * were overpaid by mistake\n\n\n\nFind out how to [repay the money you owe from benefit overpayment](/benefit-overpayments).\n\n## If you\u2019re nearing the end of life\n\nYou may get extra money if you\u2019re nearing the end of life because of an illness. You may also be able to [get other benefits](/benefits-end-of-life).\n\n### If you\u2019ve been told you might have more than 12 months to live\n\nYou\u2019ll need to report this in the same way as any other change of circumstance.\n\n### If you\u2019ve been told you might have 12 months or less to live\n\nReport the change online through your [Universal Credit account](/sign-in-universal-credit). You\u2019ll be contacted about what to do next.\n\nYou can also get someone else to report the change for you. They should ask a doctor or medical professional to fill in form SR1.\n\nThe doctor will have the form already.

      "poorly_written_article": "So, like, Universal Credit is this thing that helps with your costs of living, which is kinda nice. It gets paid to you every month, or, you know, some folks in Scotland get it twice a month or whatever \u2013 that\u2019s cool, I guess.\n\nYou might be able to get this if you\u2019re making very little money, like you don't have a job, or you\u2019re just not able to work at all. Also, there\u2019s this guide available in, like, Welsh too, and they have an easy-read version for people who need that. Oh, and if you're in Northern Ireland, there\u2019s a different section for you guys. Totally different!\n\nNow, if you\u2019ve already got other benefits (like tax credits), know that Universal Credit is taking away some old ones like Child Tax Credit and Housing Benefit. So if you\u2019re still receiving any of those, chill for a bit unless something changes or you get this letter called a \u2018Migration Notice,\u2019 which sounds kinda official, right? If you have to switch to Universal Credit because of that letter, don\u2019t wait too long \u2013 you gotta do it within three months. Otherwise, no more cash for you from the old benefits!\n\nAnd if you or your partner is getting Pension Credit, that\u2019ll stop if you claim Universal Credit. Super confusing but whatever, it happens. You\u2019ll still get other kinds of help, like Personal Independence Payment or Carer\u2019s Allowance. You can read a bit more about how they affect each other on some other page.\n\nIf you're, like, super low on cash or need help with living costs, then you could totally be eligible for Universal Credit. Anyone out of work, working sometimes, or can\u2019t work because of some health issues might fit the bill too. But first, here\u2019s what you need to get in \u2013 you gotta be over 18, which is kind of a no-brainer, right? And of course, no more than \u00a316,000 in savings or investments.  \n\nSo, like, EU folks and Swiss citizens need to check out if they have settled or pre-settled status to get Universal Credit, which is kinda a bummer but okay. \n\nNow, if you live with a partner, you both need to claim together. Even if one of you doesn\u2019t really qualify, you still have to do it together, like a team. It\u2019s so romantic! But if only one of you is, like, at or over state pension age, you can still claim together until, you know, both of you hit that age.\n\nIf you\u2019re, like, in school or training or something, you can still make a claim for Universal Credit! But it gets a bit tricky, especially if you have kids or your partner is eligible, etc. There's, like, all these other rules that can apply to you if you\u2019re under 21 and studying too. Plus, if you have a health condition, there are even more avenues to check out.\n\nOh, and if you\u2019re 16 or 17, you might qualify if you have health issues, care for someone, or are expecting a baby soon. Basically, there\u2019s a lot of stuff you can look into. \n\nWhen it comes to the actual amount you\u2019ll receive, it\u2019s like, it can vary, and it usually changes based on your household. There\u2019s a \u2018standard allowance\u2019 that\u2019s, like, the base amount you get each month, and it changes a bit based on if you\u2019re solo or living with a partner.\n\nSo if you\u2019re single and under 25, you\u2019ll get about \u00a3311.68, and if you\u2019re over that age, it bumps up to around \u00a3393.45. If you\u2019re living with your partner and both under 25, together you\u2019d get about \u00a3489.23! Pretty neat, huh?\n\nOh, and then there are extra amounts you might snag if you have kids living with you or if any of them have disabilities. The rates differ a lot, but you can get, like, an extra \u00a3156.11 if your child\u2019s got some disabilities \u2013 it\u2019s, like, a nice boost when you have kids around.\n\nIf you need help with childcare because you\u2019re working and stuff, you might get a big chunk back like up to 85% of it! How amazing is that? But be careful with how you manage your money because if you\u2019ve got repayments for some loans or if you hit certain benefit caps, your amount will probably drop.\n\nOkay, so when you claim, just know that things like how much you earn impacts your Universal Credit too. It really depends on how many hours you work and your income. If you\u2019re making cash, your payment gets lower. But, like, you can work as much as possible, and that\u2019s a good thing! \n\nAnd don\u2019t forget about the first payment, which takes around five weeks \u2013 so if you\u2019re, like, struggling before that, you can apply for an advance. It\u2019s kinda like getting a loan from yourself but with payback.  \n\nJust remember to keep track of all the changes in your life like if you get a job or whatever. You gotta tell them, or it could mess up your Universal Credit, and we don\u2019t want that chaos.  \n\nIn the end, if you have any problems or questions about Universal Credit, you can totally call the helpline or ask a work coach for help. They\u2019re pretty helpful when it comes down to it. Just don\u2019t get too stressed about it; there\u2019s always some support out there!",

It\u2019s being replaced by Universal Credit.\n\nYou can only make a new claim for Housing Benefit if either of the following apply:\n\n  * you have reached [State Pension age](/state-pension-age)\n  * you\u2019re in supported, sheltered or temporary housing\n\n\n\nThis guide is also available [in Welsh (Cymraeg)](/budd-dal-tai).\n\n## You\u2019ve reached State Pension age\n\nIf you\u2019re single you can make a new claim for Housing Benefit.\n\n### If you\u2019re over State Pension age and live with your partner\n\nYou can make a new claim for Housing Benefit if any of the following apply:\n\n  * you and your partner have both reached State Pension age\n  * one of you has reached State Pension age and started claiming Pension Credit (for you as a couple) before 15 May 2019\n  * you\u2019re in supported, sheltered or temporary housing\n\n\n\n### If you\u2019re over State Pension age and have an existing claim\n\nYour existing claim will not be affected if, before 15 May 2019, you:\n\n  * were getting Housing Benefit\n  * had reached State Pension age\n\n\n\nIt does not matter if your partner is under State Pension age.\n\nIf your circumstances change and your Housing Benefit is stopped, you cannot start getting it again unless you and your partner are eligible to make a new claim.\n\nYou can [apply for Universal Credit](/universal-credit) if you\u2019re not eligible.\n\n## If you\u2019re in supported, sheltered or temporary housing\n\nYou can make a new claim if:\n\n  * you\u2019re living in temporary accommodation, such as a B&B arranged by your council\n  * you\u2019re living in a refuge for survivors of domestic abuse\n  * you\u2019re living in sheltered or supported housing (such as a hostel) which provides you with \u2018care, support or supervision\u2019\n\n\n\nIf you do not get \u2018care, support or supervision\u2019 through your supported or sheltered housing, you can apply for [Universal Credit to help with housing costs](/housing-and-universal-credit).\n\nIf you\u2019re in supported, sheltered or temporary housing, you can apply for Universal Credit to help with other living costs.\n\n## When you may not be able to claim\n\nUsually, you will not get Housing Benefit if:\n\n  * your savings are over \u00a316,000 - unless you get Guarantee Credit of Pension Credit\n  * you\u2019re paying a mortgage on your own home - you may be able to get [Support for Mortgage Interest (SMI)](/support-for-mortgage-interest)\n  * you live in the home of a close relative\n  * you\u2019re already claiming [Universal Credit](/housing-and-universal-credit) (unless you\u2019re in temporary or supported housing)\n  * you live with your partner and they are already claiming Housing Benefit\n  * you\u2019re a full-time student\n  * you\u2019re residing in the UK as a [European Economic Area (EEA)](/eu-eea) jobseeker\n  * you\u2019re an asylum seeker or sponsored to be in the UK\n  * you\u2019re subject to immigration control and your granted leave states that you cannot claim public funds\n  * you\u2019re a Crown Tenant\n  * you\u2019ve reached State Pension age but your live-in partner has not - unless you had an existing claim as a couple before 15 May 2019\n\n\n\nYou may be able to get [other help with housing costs](/housing-benefit/other-help-with-housing-costs).\n\nIf not, you\u2019ll need to [claim Universal Credit](/housing-and-universal-credit) instead.\n\nUse a [benefits calculator](/benefits-calculators) to check if you can get Housing Benefit before you apply.\n\n## What you'll get \n\nYou may get help with all or part of your rent. There\u2019s no set amount of Housing Benefit and what you get will depend on whether you rent privately or from a council.\n\nUse a [benefits calculator](/benefits-calculators) to work out what you could get or check what [extra help](/housing-benefit/other-help-with-housing-costs) is available.\n\n## Council and social housing rent\n\nHow much you get depends on:\n\n  * your \u2018eligible\u2019 rent\n  * if you have a spare room\n  * your household income - including benefits, pensions and savings (over \u00a36,000)\n  * your circumstances, for example the age of people in the house or if someone has a disability\n\n\n\n### Eligible rent\n\nYour eligible rent is the amount used to calculate your Housing Benefit claim. It\u2019s your actual rent plus any service charges you have to pay (such as for lift maintenance or a communal laundry) but not things like heating or water costs for your home.\n\n### Spare bedrooms\n\nYour Housing Benefit could be reduced if you live in council or social housing and have a spare bedroom. The reduction is:\n\n  * 14% of the \u2018eligible rent\u2019 for 1 spare bedroom\n  * 25% of the \u2018eligible rent\u2019 for 2 or more spare bedrooms\n\n\n\nExample\n\nYour eligible rent is \u00a3100 per week, but you have 1 spare bedroom. That means your eligible rent is reduced by 14%, to \u00a386 per week. Your Housing Benefit will be calculated using that figure.\n\n### Sharing bedrooms\n\nThe following are expected to share:\n\n  * an adult couple\n  * 2 children under 16 of the same sex\n  * 2 children under 10 (regardless of sex)\n\n\n\nThe following can have their own bedroom:\n\n  * a single adult (16 or over)\n  * a child that would normally share but shared bedrooms are already taken, for example you have 3 children and 2 already share\n  * a couple or children who cannot share because of a disability or medical condition\n  * an overnight carer for you, your partner, your child or another adult - this is only if the carer does not live with you but sometimes has to stay overnight\n\n\n\nOne spare bedroom is allowed for:\n\n  * an approved foster carer who is between placements but only for up to 52 weeks from the end of the last placement\n  * a newly approved foster carer for up to 52 weeks from the date of approval if no child is placed with them during that time\n\n\n\nRooms used by students and members of the armed or reserve forces will not be counted as \u2018spare\u2019 if they\u2019re away and intend to return home.\n\n## Private rent\n\nIf you rent privately, your eligible rent amount is either your [Local Housing Allowance (LHA) rate](https://lha-direct.voa.gov.uk/search.aspx) or your actual rent, whichever is lower. The LHA rate is based on:\n\n  * where you live\n  * your household size - [find out how many bedrooms you\u2019re eligible for](http://lha-direct.voa.gov.uk/bedroomcalculator.aspx)\n\n\n\n### How much you can get\n\nHow much you get depends on:\n\n  * the lower figure of your \u2018eligible\u2019 rent or LHA rate\n  * your household income including benefits, pensions and savings (over \u00a36,000)\n  * your circumstances (for example your age or whether you have a disability)\n\n\n\n[Contact your local council](/find-your-local-council) if you\u2019re living in:\n\n  * a houseboat or a mooring\n  * a caravan site\n  * a room with any meals included in the rent (sometimes known as a boarding home)\n  * a hostel\n  * a Rent Act protected property\n\n\n\n### Exception\n\nIf you\u2019ve been getting Housing Benefit since before 7 April 2008, these limits only apply if you:\n\n  * change address\n  * have a break in your claim for Housing Benefit\n\n\n\n## How you\u2019re paid\n\nThe way you get paid Housing Benefit by your council depends on the type of tenant you are.\n\nIf you\u2019re a:\n\n  * council tenant, it\u2019s paid into your rent account (you will not receive the money)\n  * private or housing association tenant, it\u2019s paid into your bank or building society account (rarely by cheque)\n\n\n\n## The benefit cap\n\nThe [benefit cap](/benefit-cap) limits the total amount of benefit you can get. It applies to most people aged 16 or over who have not reached [State Pension age](/state-pension-age).\n\nIf you\u2019re affected, your Housing Benefit will go down to make sure that the total amount of benefit you get is not more than the [cap level](/benefit-cap/benefit-cap-amounts).\n\n## Appeal a Housing Benefit decision\n\n[Contact your local council to appeal a Housing Benefit decision](/appeal-housing-benefit-decision).\n\n## Supporting your claim \n\nYou\u2019ll need to provide some information and evidence to support your claim for Housing Benefit.\n\nYou\u2019ll get Housing Benefit faster if you have this available when you make your claim.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to know:\n\n  * how much rent you pay\n  * whether anything else is included in the rent, such as water, gas or electricity charges\n  * if you pay any service charges, including building maintenance or insurance\n  * your landlord or agent\u2019s details\n\n\n\n### Special types of tenancy\n\nIf your current tenancy started in 1997 or earlier and you rent from a private landlord, you\u2019ll need to know if you have an \u2018assured tenancy\u2019. You can [check your tenancy on the Shelter website](https://england.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/downloads_and_tools/tenancy_rights_checker/).\n\nIf you live in and pay rent for a government property (a \u2018Crown Tenant\u2019), you\u2019re not entitled to Housing Benefit. This includes armed forces living in service family accommodation (SFA).\n\n## Evidence you\u2019ll have to provide\n\nYou\u2019ll need to provide original documents, not copies. The supporting evidence you\u2019ll need includes:\n\n  * your most recent payslips (5 if paid weekly, or 2 if paid monthly)\n  * bank or building society statements for the last 2 full months\n  * proof of other income or investments, including shares, ISAs or Premium Bonds\n  * proof of income for any non-dependants living with you, such as adult relatives or friends\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll also need proof of your partner\u2019s name and address.

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so let\u2019s talk about Housing Benefit, which helps you pay your rent if you're kind of low on cash or if you're not working or on benefits. But wait! It's gonna be replaced by Universal Credit soon, so that's important. \n\nSo, you can only ask for Housing Benefit if you either hit that State Pension age or you live in some special housing like temporary or supported places. \n\n### If You\u2019re Old Enough for State Pension \n\nIf you're single and reached that State Pension age, you can apply for Housing Benefit. Now, if you\u2019re living with your partner and both of you are over that age or if one of you got Pension Credit before May 15th, 2019, you can also apply. You know, and if you\u2019re in that supported housing, go for it too. \n\n### Existing Claims \n\nIf you were already getting Housing Benefit before that May date and reached the State Pension age, then your benefits won't change. Even if your partner is younger, it\u2019s still okay. But if your life changes, like if you lose your Benefit, then you gotta wait until you both can apply again. If not, try Universal Credit instead.\n\n### Supported Housing Situations  \n\nYou can get a new claim too if you\u2019re in a B&B, or a refuge, or any place giving you extra support. If you're not getting that support in your housing, then just go for Universal Credit to help with your rent and living costs. \n\n### When You Can't Claim \n\nMost of the time, you can\u2019t get Housing Benefit if you've got like more than \u00a316,000 in savings unless you qualify for a special credit. And if you own a home, nope! But if you live with close family or are a full-time student or are on Universal Credit, you can\u2019t claim either. So just keep that in mind, alright? \n\n### What You Might Get \n \nWhen you do get Housing Benefit, how much you get is kinda up in the air. It depends on your rent situation, like if you're renting from a council or privately. For council rents, we look at what you owe your landlord, any extra charges, and if you have spare rooms. You know, like if you have one spare room, they'll cut your help by 14%, like that.\n\n### Private Rent Deal \n\nNow, if you\u2019re renting from someone private, it's either your actual rent or some Local Housing Allowance rate (LHA), whichever's less. And it varies based on where you live, and how many rooms you need.\n\n### Payments \n\nYou get paid differently based on if you're a council tenant or not. If you're council, the money goes straight to your account like that. But private tenants get it in their bank.\n\n### The Benefit Cap  \n\nOh, and there's this cap thing, so if you're over a certain amount, your Housing Benefit can be lowered.\n\n### Appeals  \n\nIf you\u2019re not happy with how things go, you can appeal, like contact your council and see what they say. \n\n### Reporting Changes  \n\nReally, if something in your life changes like a job or who lives with you, you gotta tell the council, or they might mess with your benefits. Could be anything, moving houses, work changes, or money changes. \n\n### Extra Help  \n\nIf Housing Benefit doesn\u2019t cover all your rent, talk to your local council for a Discretionary Housing Payment. They might help you out. \n\nSo, yeah, if you're lost or need a hand, try checking in with Citizens Advice or something like that. \n\nIn the end, getting that Housing Benefit is like navigating a maze, so keep your stuff in order and check what you need before applying. It's a bit wild, but don\u2019t fret! You got this!",

[If you\u2019re currently getting income-based JSA](/jobseekers-allowance/if-youre-getting-income-based-jsa), you\u2019ll keep getting payments while you\u2019re eligible until your claim ends.\n\nYou could get Universal Credit at the same time or instead of New Style JSA. [Check if you\u2019re eligible for Universal Credit](/universal-credit/eligibility).\n\n## What you need to do\n\n  1. [Check you\u2019re eligible](/jobseekers-allowance/eligibility).\n\n  2. [Make a claim for New Style Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA)](/jobseekers-allowance/apply-new-style-jsa) and go to an interview at your local Jobcentre Plus office.\n\n  3. Keep to your agreement to look for work. This agreement is called a \u2018Claimant Commitment\u2019 and you will create it at your interview.\n\n\n\n\n[Your JSA payments will be reduced or stopped](/jobseekers-allowance/your-jsa-claim) if you do not keep to your agreement to look for work and cannot give a good reason.\n\n## What you\u2019ll get\n\nThere\u2019s a maximum amount you can get - but how much you\u2019re entitled to depends on your age.\n\nUse a [benefits calculator](/benefits-calculators) to check how much JSA you can get, and how your other benefits will be affected.\n\nAge |  JSA weekly amount  \n---|---  \nUp to 24 | up to \u00a371.70  \n25 or over | up to \u00a390.50  \n  \n## How you\u2019re paid\n\nAll benefits, pensions and allowances are usually paid into your [bank, building society or credit union account](/how-to-have-your-benefits-paid).\n\n### Your first payment\n\nYou may have to wait up to 7 days after applying for your JSA to start, and up to 2 weeks after that to get your first payment.\n\nYour first payment may not be for the full amount.\n\n### After your first payment\n\nPayments will usually be made every 2 weeks and they will be the full amount.\n\n## If you\u2019re moving to Universal Credit from income-based JSA\n\nIf your income-based JSA claim is ending because you\u2019re making a new claim for Universal Credit, you\u2019ll automatically continue to get the amount of JSA you currently receive, as long as you\u2019re still eligible. You\u2019ll normally get this for 2 weeks, starting from the date of your new claim.\n\nThe Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will write to you telling you how this works.\n\nYou do not need to pay this money back, and it will not affect the amount of Universal Credit you get.\n\n## Eligibility \n\nTo be eligible for New Style Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA) you\u2019ll need to have both:\n\n  * worked as an employee\n  * paid Class 1 National Insurance contributions, usually in the last 2 to 3 years ([National Insurance credits](/national-insurance-credits) can also count)\n\n\n\nYou will not be eligible if you were self-employed and only paid Class 2 National Insurance contributions, unless you were working as a share fisherman or a volunteer development worker.\n\nYou\u2019ll also need to:\n\n  * be 18 or over (there are some exceptions if you\u2019re 16 or 17 - [contact Jobcentre Plus](/contact-jobcentre-plus) for advice)\n  * be under the [State Pension age](/check-state-pension)\n  * not be in full-time education\n  * be available for work\n  * not be working at the moment, or be working less than 16 hours per week on average\n  * not have an illness or disability which stops you from working\n  * live in the UK\n\n\n\nWhile you receive JSA, you\u2019ll need to take reasonable steps to look for work as agreed with your work coach.\n\nYour savings and your partner\u2019s income and savings will not affect your claim.\n\nYou can get New Style Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA) for up to 182 days (about 6 months). After this you can talk to your work coach about your options.\n\n## Claiming Universal Credit and New Style JSA\n\nYou might be able to get [Universal Credit](/universal-credit) at the same time or instead of New Style JSA.\n\nIf you get both benefits, your New Style JSA payments:\n\n  * count as income when claiming Universal Credit\n  * will reduce the amount of Universal Credit you receive\n\n\n\nYour New Style JSA will usually be paid more regularly than Universal Credit. You\u2019ll also get different [National Insurance credits](/national-insurance-credits) which count towards your State Pension and help you qualify for other benefits.\n\n[Check if you\u2019re eligible for Universal Credit](/universal-credit/eligibility).\n\n## Apply for New Style Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) \n\nBefore you apply for New Style Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA), [check if you\u2019re eligible](/jobseekers-allowance/eligibility).\n\nTo apply, you\u2019ll need your:\n\n  * [National Insurance number](/lost-national-insurance-number)\n  * bank or building society account details (or those of a family member or trusted friend)\n  * employment details for the past 6 months, including employer contact details and dates you worked with them\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll also need to provide a statement letter if you receive any money from:\n\n  * your [private pension](/pension-types)\n  * your [workplace pension](/workplace-pensions)\n  * an [annuity you\u2019ve bought](/personal-pensions-your-rights/how-you-can-take-pension)\n\n\n\nTo reclaim you need to apply again, even if your details have not changed.\n\nYou can backdate your claim by up to 3 months in certain circumstances.\n\n## Apply online\n\nYou cannot apply online if you\u2019re under 18 or if you\u2019re applying as an appointee on someone else\u2019s behalf.\n\n[Apply for New Style JSA](https://www.dwpe-services.direct.gov.uk/en/jobseekersallowanceclaim)\n\n## If you cannot apply online or need alternative formats\n\nYou can apply another way if any of the following apply:\n\n  * you\u2019re aged 16 to 17\n  * you\u2019re applying as an appointee on someone else\u2019s behalf\n  * you need help applying\n  * you need communications to be sent to you in an alternative format, such as braille, large print or audio CD\n\n\n\nYou need to either:\n\n  * [contact Jobcentre Plus](/contact-jobcentre-plus/new-benefit-claims) if you live in England, Scotland or Wales\n  * [contact the Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance Processing Centre](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/contacts/jobseekers-allowance-processing-centre) if you live in Northern Ireland\n\n\n\n## After you make your claim\n\nIf you gave your mobile number or email address in your online application, you\u2019ll get a text or email to confirm it\u2019s been submitted.\n\nThe Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will then contact you within 14 days of applying. You\u2019ll either:\n\n  * be [invited to an interview at your local Jobcentre Plus office](/jobseekers-allowance/your-jsa-interview)\n  * receive a letter to explain why you\u2019re not eligible for JSA\n\n\n\nYou do not need to contact DWP unless it has been more than 14 days since you applied and you have not heard anything.\n\n## If you disagree with a decision\n\nYou can [challenge a decision](/mandatory-reconsideration) about your claim. This is called asking for mandatory reconsideration.\n\n## Make a complaint\n\nYou can [complain about Jobcentre Plus](/complain-jobcentre-plus) if you\u2019re unhappy with the service you\u2019ve received.\n\n## Your JSA interview \n\nIf you\u2019re invited to an interview, you must attend. It will be at your local Jobcentre Plus office.\n\nYou\u2019ll be asked some questions to confirm your identity and then you\u2019ll make an agreement about what steps you\u2019ll take to look for work.\n\n## Documents you need to bring to your interview\n\nYou\u2019ll need to bring all of the following:\n\n  * one photographic proof of identity\n  * one proof of address\n  * one further proof of identity\n\n\n\nIf you have a [P45 from your employer](/paye-forms-p45-p60-p11d), bring this to your interview. When you present it, tell your work coach if you\u2019ve already received or claimed a tax refund from HMRC for the current tax year.\n\nYou can also use your P45 as your further proof of identity.\n\n### Photographic proof of identity\n\nExamples include your:\n\n  * current passport\n  * driving licence\n  * biometric residence permit (BRP) or eVisa\n  * certificate of naturalisation as a British citizen\n  * permanent residence permit\n\n\n\n### Proof of address\n\nExamples include a:\n\n  * payslip or pension statement dated within the last 6 months\n  * utility bill dated within the last 6 months\n  * Council Tax bill dated within the last 6 months\n  * student loan documentation\n\n\n\n### Further proof of identity\n\nExamples include your:\n\n  * P60\n  * savings account book\n  * personal cheque book\n  * current debit, credit or store card with a statement confirming the card details\n\n\n\nUtility bills can be used for proof of address and as further proof of identity if they are from different suppliers.\n\n[Read the complete list of documents you can bring to your interview](/jobcentre-plus-interview).\n\n## Support at your interview\n\nYou can take someone with you to your JSA interview.\n\n[Contact your Jobcentre Plus](https://find-your-nearest-jobcentre.dwp.gov.uk/) before the interview if you need:\n\n  * support because of a disability or health condition (for example, if you\u2019re deaf and need a sign language interpreter)\n  * a foreign language interpreter and do not have someone who can help with interpretation\n\n\n\n## Sign an agreement to look for work (\u2018Claimant Commitment\u2019)\n\nAt your JSA interview, you must sign an agreement about what steps you\u2019ll take to look for a job. This is called a \u2018Claimant Commitment\u2019.\n\nYou and your work coach will agree what goes in your Claimant Commitment. This could include:\n\n  * what you need to do to look for work - for example registering with recruitment agencies, writing a CV\n  * how many hours you need to spend looking for work each week\n\n\n\nWhat you agree to do will depend on things like:\n\n  * your health\n  * your responsibilities at home\n  * how much help you need to get work or increase your income\n\n\n\n[Your JSA might be reduced or stopped](/jobseekers-allowance/your-jsa-claim) if you do not do what you\u2019ve agreed to in your Claimant Commitment and you cannot give a good reason\n\n## After your JSA interview\n\nThe Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will write to you to either:\n\n  * let you know you are eligible for JSA and how much you\u2019ll get\n  * explain why you\u2019re not eligible for JSA\n\n\n\nYou will not need to do what you\u2019ve agreed in your Claimant Commitment if you\u2019re not eligible for JSA.\n\n## Your JSA claim \n\nWhen you apply to claim JSA, your work coach will make an agreement with you to look for work. This agreement is called a \u2018Claimant Commitment\u2019.\n\nYour Claimant Commitment could include:\n\n  * what you need to do to look for work - for example registering with recruitment agencies or writing a CV\n  * how many hours you need to spend looking for work each week\n\n\n\nYou should continue to do all the things you have agreed to do if you can do them safely.\n\nYou can search and apply for work using the [\u2018Find a job\u2019 service](/find-a-job).\n\nYou must tell Jobcentre Plus [if your circumstances change](/jobseekers-allowance/report-a-change-of-circumstances), for example you start working or your income changes.\n\n## Attending regular appointments\n\nYour work coach will arrange appointments with you every 1 to 2 weeks.\n\nAt these appointments, you must show your work coach what you\u2019ve been doing to look for work, for example proof of job applications and interviews.\n\nIf you\u2019re a victim of domestic abuse you might be able to get a break of up to 13 weeks from job seeking - speak to your work coach if you need this support.\n\n## When payment can be reduced or stopped\n\nYour JSA payments can be reduced or stopped for a period if you do not do something your work coach asks you to do. This is called being \u2018sanctioned\u2019. For example, if you:\n\n  * do not take part in an appointment with your work coach\n  * do not accept or keep to your agreement to look for work\n  * turn down a job or training course\n  * do not apply for any jobs you\u2019re told about\n  * do not take part in any interviews you\u2019re invited to\n  * do not go to any training booked for you or take part in employment schemes\n\n\n\nYou may also be sanctioned if you:\n\n  * are not available to start work straight away\n  * choose to take a pay cut at your current job without a good reason\n  * have your pay cut at your current job because of something you did, such as your behaviour\n  * leave your last job or training without good reason or because of your behaviour\n\n\n\n[Contact Jobcentre Plus](/contact-jobcentre-plus) as soon as possible if any of these apply to you. You may be able to keep your payment if you have good reason.\n\nYou\u2019ll be told how long your payment will be reduced or stopped for. It could be for up to 26 weeks (about 6 months).\n\nIf you want to know how long your JSA payment could be reduced or stopped for, [read part 3 or part 4 of the guidance on JSA sanctions](/government/publications/jobseekers-allowance-sanctions-leaflet/jobseekers-allowance-sanctions-how-to-keep-your-benefit-payment).\n\n### If your JSA payment is reduced or stopped\n\nIf your payment is reduced or stopped, you should keep looking for work. Your benefit payment could be affected for longer if you do not.\n\nIf you disagree with the decision to stop payment, you can [ask for the decision to be looked at again](/mandatory-reconsideration) \\- this is called \u2018mandatory reconsideration\u2019.\n\nIf you disagree with the outcome of the mandatory reconsideration, you can [appeal to the Social Security and Child Support Tribunal](/social-security-child-support-tribunal).\n\nYou should continue with any JSA claim until the dispute is settled.\n\n### If you claim Housing Benefit or Council Tax Reduction\n\nYou should [contact your local council](/find-your-local-council) immediately. They\u2019ll tell you what to do to continue getting support.\n\n## If your claim is ended\n\nIf you get income-based JSA, your claim may be ended if you\u2019re not available for or actively seeking work.\n\nYou cannot apply for income-based JSA again. Instead, check if you\u2019re [eligible for Universal Credit](/universal-credit/eligibility) and [eligible for New Style Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA)](/jobseekers-allowance/eligibility). You could get both at the same time.\n\n## Hardship payments\n\nIf you were claiming income-based JSA, you may be able to get a hardship payment if your JSA payments have been stopped. You do not have to pay it back.\n\nA hardship payment is a reduced amount (usually 60%) of your JSA.\n\nIf you were claiming New Style Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA), you cannot get a hardship payment.\n\n### Eligibility\n\nYou can get a hardship payment if you cannot pay for rent, heating, food or other basic needs for you or your child.\n\nYou must be 18 or over.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to show that you\u2019ve tried to find the money from somewhere else, such as borrowing from a friend or working extra hours.\n\n### How to claim\n\nSpeak to your Jobcentre Plus adviser or work coach to find out how to claim a hardship payment.\n\nJobcentre Plus  \nTelephone: 0800 169 0310  \nTextphone: 0800 169 0314  \nWelsh language: 0800 328 1744  \nMonday to Friday, 8am to 6pm  \n[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)\n\n## If you\u2019re getting income-based JSA \n\nAs long as you\u2019re still eligible, you\u2019ll keep getting income-based Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA) until [your circumstances change](/jobseekers-allowance/report-a-change-of-circumstances).\n\nJobcentre Plus will talk to you about your options. If you\u2019re eligible you might be able to claim [Universal Credit](/universal-credit).\n\nYou need to take reasonable steps to look for work while getting JSA.\n\nYou must tell Jobcentre Plus if [your circumstances change](/jobseekers-allowance/report-a-change-of-circumstances), for example you start working or your income changes.\n\n## Working hours and income\n\nIf you start working more than 16 hours a week, you might stop being eligible for JSA.\n\nYou might stop being eligible for income-based JSA if:\n\n  * your partner starts working 24 hours or more a week, or increases their hours to 16 hours or more a week\n  * your savings increase to \u00a316,000 or more (including your partner\u2019s savings)\n\n\n\nYou cannot apply for income-based JSA any more. Instead, check if you\u2019re [eligible for Universal Credit](/universal-credit/eligibility) and [New Style JSA](/jobseekers-allowance/apply-new-style-jsa/eligibility). You could get both at the same time.\n\n## Report a change of circumstances \n\nYou must tell Jobcentre Plus if your circumstances change, for example you start working or your income changes. This might affect how much Jobseekers\u2019 Allowance (JSA) you get. \n\nIf you get more than one benefit, you\u2019ll need to report your change to each benefit office.\n\nThis page does not cover every change you must report. Call Jobcentre Plus if you\u2019re not sure whether you need to report a change.\n\nYour claim might be reduced or stopped if you do not report a change straight away.\n\n## New Style JSA\n\nIf you get New Style JSA, you must report if you: \n\n  * change your name, address, bank details or telephone number\n\n  * become ill or go into hospital\n\n  * start or stop caring for someone\n\n  * start or stop education, training or an apprenticeship\n\n  * start a job, including self-employment\n\n  * do any paid, unpaid or voluntary work, even if it is only for a few hours\n\n  * start getting, stop getting, or get a different amount of other benefits or pensions\n\n  * leave Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) for any period of time\n\n  * go on holiday, including holidays in Great Britain\n\n\n\n\n## Income-based JSA\n\nIf you get income-based Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance, you must report the following changes.\n\n### Changes to personal details\n\nYou need to report if:\n\n  * you or your partner change name, address, bank details or telephone number \n\n  * anybody starts or stops living with you \n\n  * you or someone included on your claim changes immigration status\n\n  * you go on holiday, including holidays in Great Britain\n\n  * you or anyone who lives with you leaves Great Britain (England, Scotland or Wales) for any period of time\n\n  * your partner or someone you live with dies\n\n\n\n\nYou also need to report if you, your partner, or anyone who lives with you:\n\n  * gets married or forms a civil partnership\n\n  * gets divorced or ends a civil partnership \n\n  * has a baby or gets pregnant\n\n  * goes into prison or legal custody\n\n\n\n\n### Changes to work and education\n\nYou need to report if you, your partner, or anyone who lives with you:\n\n  * starts or stops education, training or an apprenticeship\n\n  * finds or finishes a job, or starts working different hours\n\n  * is involved in a trade dispute, or unable to work because of a trade dispute (for example, if there\u2019s a strike)\n\n\n\n\nVolunteering will not normally affect your JSA but you should report it before you start.\n\n### Changes to income and benefits\n\nYou need to report if your household income goes up or down. Tell us if you or anyone who lives with you:\n\n  * has a change to earnings\n\n  * gets paid back-pay (sometimes called \u2018arrears\u2019) for earnings from work\n\n  * gets a different amount of benefit or pensions\n\n  * has a change to the amount of any other money coming in (for example student loans or grants, sick pay or money from a charity)\n\n\n\n\n### Changes to your savings or assets\n\nYou need to report if the total savings and assets in your household is more than \u00a36,000.\n\nYou also need to report if you or anyone who lives with you:\n\n  * has a change to the amount of savings or investments they own \n\n  * becomes the owner of any land, buildings or premises or sells any land, buildings or premises\n\n  * gets a one-off payment such as inheritance or lump sum payment\n\n\n\n\n### Changes to a medical condition or disability\n\nYou need to report if:\n\n  * you or someone included on your claim has any changes to a medical condition or disability\n\n  * you or someone included on your claim goes into hospital, a care home or sheltered accommodation\n\n  * you or someone included on your claim starts or stops caring for someone\n\n  * anybody starts or stops getting Carer\u2019s Allowance, Carer Support Payment or an extra amount of Universal Credit for caring for you\n\n\n\n\nYou may be prosecuted or have to pay a \u00a350 penalty if you give wrong or incomplete information, or do not report changes straight away.\n\n## How to report\n\nYou can report a change of circumstances by:\n\n  * calling the JSA helpline\n  * writing to the Jobcentre Plus office that pays your JSA \\- the address is on the letters you get about your JSA\n\n\n\nIf your partner or someone you live with has died, you can tell Jobcentre Plus and other government organisations in one go using the [Tell Us Once service](/after-a-death/organisations-you-need-to-contact-and-tell-us-once).\n\nJSA and New Style Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA) helpline  \nTelephone: 0800 169 0310  \nTextphone: 0800 169 0314  \n[Relay UK](https://www.relayuk.bt.com) (if you cannot hear or speak on the phone): 18001 then 0800 169 0310  \nBritish Sign Language (BSL) [video relay service](https://connect.interpreterslive.co.uk/vrs?ilc=DWP) if you\u2019re on a computer - find out how to [use the service on mobile or tablet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oELNMfAvDxw)  \nWelsh language: 0800 328 1744\n\nMonday to Friday, 8am to 5pm  \n[Find out about call charges](/call-charges)\n\nIf you\u2019re claiming [Universal Credit](/universal-credit/changes-of-circumstances) as well as New Style Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance (JSA), you must report changes to both services.\n\n## If you\u2019ve been paid too much\n\nIf you do not report a change straight away or give wrong or incomplete information, you might be paid too much.

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so like, if you're looking for a job (which I mean, who isn't these days, right?), you can apply for this thing called the New Style Jobseeker's Allowance, or JSA for short. It's kinda there to help you out when you're job hunting. Oh, and there's this version of the guide in Welsh if you care about that, I guess.\n\nSo um, you can't apply for this older income-based JSA stuff anymore, which is... confusing? If you\u2019re still getting it, you can keep getting paid until they say no more. If you're still in the game, you might see about getting Universal Credit too, which is another benefit thingy.\n\n### What You Gotta Do\n\n- First, you should [check if you can actually apply](http://something.com) because that\u2019s kinda important, right?\n\n- Then, you need to [make a claim for JSA](http://something.com) and go talk to someone at the Jobcentre Plus office, which is like your local job help center.\n\n- Also, you gotta stick to this thing called a 'Claimant Commitment' where you promise to look for work or whatever. If you don't keep up with that, they might cut your payments, which could suck.\n\n### What You\u2019ll Get\n\nSo, there\u2019s a limit on what you can get, but it totally depends on how old you are. For people under 24, you could get up to \u00a371.70 a week, and if you're 25 or older, you can get \u00a390.50 a week - but that\u2019s the max. You can use [a benefits calculator here](http://something.com) to see how much you might actually get. \n\n### How Payments Work\n\nMost of the time, they pay everything into your bank account or whatever. Your first payment might take a little while\u2014like a whole week after you apply, and then another week to actually see the cash, assuming you're lucky? But don't get your hopes up too high, because it might not even be the full amount at first. \n\nAfter that, they pay you every two weeks, which is cool, I guess? \n\n### If You're Switching Benefits\n\nNow, if for some reason you're rolling from the income-based JSA to Universal Credit, you\u2019ll keep getting the same JSA amount for like 2 weeks after your new claim. So that\u2019s nice, right? You don't have to pay it back either, which is a bonus. \n\n### Eligibility Stuff\n\nTo even get New Style JSA, you basically need to show you worked and paid National Insurance stuff, like in the last couple of years. It\u2019s gotta be Class 1 contributions, otherwise, you\u2019re out of luck. And obviously, you need to be over 18 and not in school full-time, which is kinda a no-brainer.\n\nOh, and if you\u2019re a bit sick or can\u2019t work for a good reason, that\u2019ll also kick you out of eligibility. You\u2019ve got to live in the UK too, so keep that in mind! \n\n### Applying\n\nBefore you apply, having your National Insurance number and bank details is a must. If you get confused, just [apply online here](http://something.com). But heads up, if you\u2019re under 18, you can\u2019t do it online. You\u2019ll have to find another way, like calling or something. \n\n### Interview Time\n\nIf they call you for an interview at Jobcentre Plus, make sure you go, otherwise, uh, it won't end well. Bring proof of who you are and where you live\u2014like maybe a driver's license? They\u2019ll ask you some identity questions and discuss your job search steps. \n\n### Don't Forget\n\nIf anything changes, like you get a job or your pay changes, you gotta let them know ASAP! Or else you might miss out on benefits or get penalized. It\u2019s a whole thing, but just call them if you're confused.\n\nTotally don\u2019t wanna make it sound like a nightmare, but you kinda need to keep on top of all this if you want to get your benefits without issues! Seriously, just stay organized. \n\nOkay, that\u2019s it for how to navigate this JSA thingy!",

And while we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s not forget how this could, like, totally affect any other benefits you might be juggling at the same time. For those, like, living up to age 24, you have the thrilling opportunity to possibly get \u00a371.70 weekly, while those who are 25 or older may luck out with, get this, a whopping \u00a390.50 in weekly assistance.

And just so you know, don\u2019t expect that inaugural payment to shower you with the full bounty of your benefits, nope! Instead, it\u2019s likely going to come in a rather altered form of reduced payment initially.

      "poorly_written_article": "So, uh, here\u2019s the deal with Budgeting Loans. They\u2019re like, super helpful for stuff like furniture and household things, ya know? Like washing machines, clothes, rent, and even moving costs. You can use it for all sorts of things - maternity costs and funerals too, which is kinda sad but important. Oh, and if you have some hire purchase loans, you can pay those off with a Budgeting Loan as well. But hey, watch out because Crisis Loans are like, totally gone. \n\nYou might be able to get a Budgeting Loan if you\u2019ve been on certain benefits for six months, which is pretty specific. Just gotta repay what you borrow, and they take it straight out of your benefits which is convenient. \n\nNow, let's see if you're eligible. You need to have been getting benefits like Income Support or Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance for six months. If you switched from Universal Credit to Pension Credit, that counts too. But if you have Universal Credit now, forget it! You gotta go for a Budgeting Advance instead, which is a different thing completely. \n\nSo, how much can you borrow? You can take out at least 100 pounds, but if you're single, you can get up to 348. If you have a partner, it goes up to 464, and if you claim Child Benefit, it's a whopping 812! But it all depends if you can pay it back and how much savings you have (like over 1000 pounds is a no-go).\n\nThey'll put the loan into your benefits account unless you tell them otherwise, but changing the account is possible, just takes a bit more time. Also, the cool part is there's no interest on the loan. You just pay back what you borrowed and they automatically take it from your benefits, which is nice. You usually have to pay it back within two years, so keep that in mind.\n\nIf you stop getting your benefits, you\u2019ll get a letter from DWP Debt Management telling you how to manage the repayment, either all at once or monthly, which is kinda flexible.  \n\nYou can apply online or with a paper form, but the online thing is definitely faster. Once you apply, they\u2019ll give you a decision. If you wanna ask about it, you can call the Social Fund Enquiry Line, which is open from Monday to Friday.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t like their decision, you can totally ask them to reconsider it. Just need to write them your details and stuff within 28 days.\n\nThere\u2019s other support you could check out too, like your local council or funds specific to your area. \n\nSo, yeah! That\u2019s the rundown on Budgeting Loans. Pretty simple, right? Just remember to check if you\u2019re eligible and all that jazz.",

It\u2019s like a lifeline for clothes and footwear as well, and how could we forget about that pesky rent in advance? Who doesn\u2019t NEED that while moving, am I right? And there's also stuff like maintenance and improvements for one's abode, which, duh, everyone is always worried about - or should be - plus travel costs within the UK, which, IMO, can be a total drag!

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so there's this thing called Care to Learn, and it's like a program to help you with the costs of childcare while you're hitting the books. If you're under 20 at the start of your course, then you're good to go. But, you gotta be studying one of those public funded courses in England, not like private, it\u2019s super important or whatever.  \n\nSo, here's the deal on what you can score: you can pocket up to \u00a3180 a week for each child if you're living outside London, but if you're in London, it's a bit more \u2013 like \u00a3195 per kid per week. Nice, right?  \n\nNow, they're giving you cash for stuff like your childcare costs. That includes everything from deposits to signing your kid up and even the first five days for your childcare to get a taste of what it\u2019s like. Plus, it helps keep your spot during summer breaks and covers costs of getting the little one to the childcare place.\n\nWhen it comes to payments, they go straight to your childcare provider, so you don\u2019t even get to see it, haha. But before that, your provider has to confirm your kid's actually showing up, and your school has to say you're in class. Easy peasy. The travel money goes to your school or college instead, and they decide if they\u2019re gonna pay you or do the arranging.\n\nPayments stop if you stop going to your course, reach the end of it\u2014like, you graduate or whatever\u2014or if your kid stops going to childcare.  \n\nWanna know if you can get in on this? You gotta check some boxes: must be under 20 when you start, be the main carer\u2014so basically, be the one taking care of the kid, live in England, and be a British citizen or have legal status to live there. Your chosen course and childcare place have to be cool too. \n\nIf you're from the EU, there might still be a chance if you applied for the EU Settlement Scheme before the deadline, but that\u2019s on you to figure out.\n\nOnly publicly-funded courses are eligible\u2014think schools, sixth forms, colleges, that kind of deal. Ask your learning place if your course counts.\n\nYour childcare provider? They gotta be registered\u2014either with Ofsted or a childminder agency, or be a school, like a proper institution. They can be all sorts of places like a nursery or a playgroup.\n\nBut, if you're an apprentice getting paid or in, like, a university course, you\u2019re outta luck, not qualifying for the Care to Learn aid. \n\nTo apply, you need to have chosen your learning and childcare provider first. And you gotta reapply every year, which sounds a bit annoying. If you get your application in before your course starts or within the first 28 days, your provider gets paid for your kid from the start of your course. But if you wait too long, they only get paid from that week you apply. \n\nOnce you apply, you gotta show your learning provider your kid's birth certificate or a letter proving you get Child Benefit for them, or they won\u2019t get any cash.  \n\nIf you qualify, you'll get a letter detailing the cash you can snag, plus your childcare person gets a payment plan too\u2014everybody's in the loop, cool. \n\nBut be careful, if anything changes in your life like your personal info or your childcare hours, you gotta let them know. You can just update your online application, don't overthink it.  \n\nAnd hey, claiming Care to Learn? Doesn't mess with your family's other benefits or anything. Pretty sweet deal.",

You can also speak to other organisations that are listed in your letter or with your special educational needs coordinator (SENCO).\n\n## Mediation\n\nIn most cases, you must consider mediation before you appeal to the tribunal. Mediation is when an impartial professional (the mediator) helps both sides work out an agreement.

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so like if you wanna appeal a decision that your local authority made about a kid\u2019s, like, education and health stuff, you gotta go to this SEND Tribunal, right? You can do this if you\u2019re super not okay with the EHC plan they made or if they\u2019re saying no to some things like:\n\n- Not doing an EHC assessment or reassessment, which sounds like a no-brainer but whatever.\n- They won\u2019t make an EHC plan after checking things out. \n- If they don\u2019t wanna change certain parts of an existing EHC plan, especially the education bits which are sections B, F and I. It\u2019s kinda important.\n- Saying your kid doesn\u2019t need an EHC plan anymore, which is just wild.\n\nOh and by the way, if you live in Wales, Scotland, or Northern Ireland, the way to do all this is different, so you might wanna check that out. You gotta have a chat with a mediation adviser before jumping in to appeal, mostly.\n\nYou can appeal for your kid or even if you\u2019re a young person yourself, which is kinda cool.\n\nThere\u2019s help out there too! You can get, like, legal aid possibly, and some free advice from groups like IPSEA or your local Parent Partnership Service, which is nice. Just see if you can get that and all.\n\nSo like before you actually appeal, check your decision letter. It\u2019ll say what\u2019s needed. You should also talk to your SENCO or someone who knows what\u2019s up.\n\nMediation is a thing you should check out. It\u2019s where a mediator helps you and the local authority figure things out. It\u2019s quicker than going to a tribunal and keeps things sorta private. But like, if it\u2019s just about which school or where your kid should go, then you don\u2019t have to do mediation. \n\nIf you wanna set up mediation, your local authority\u2019s letter will tell you how to do that. Or if you lost it, just call them up to get the info. The mediator will explain everything, and if you both agree, they\u2019ll help you to talk it out. You\u2019ll get a little mediation certificate which is, like, super important if you still want to appeal, so don\u2019t lose that!\n\nNow, if you\u2019re like, nah to mediation, you still need to contact the mediation service to get that certificate. If you don\u2019t have it and still wanna appeal, you\u2019ll need to explain why.\n\nYou can appeal on behalf of a child if they\u2019re not old enough to leave school. If they are over that age, they can do it themselves. The tribunal wants your appeal in two months after the decision letter or one month from that mediation certificate, whichever is later.\n\nThere\u2019s an online way and also like, a postal way if needed. If your kid\u2019s in custody or the EHC assessment hasn\u2019t happened, then it\u2019s all postal or email styles only.\n\nAfter you appeal, the tribunal checks out what you said and gets back to you in about 25 working days, which is like, a month or so? They\u2019ll tell you if there\u2019s going to be a hearing and all that jazz. You gotta send more info in a certain timeframe too.\n\nYou can change or back out of your appeal if needed before the hearing. Like if you want another date or to add witnesses, there\u2019s forms for that you gotta fill out \u2013 one for changing stuff and one if you decide to drop it.\n\nSo when you get to the hearing, it\u2019s usually gonna be a video call or in a place not too far from your house. They\u2019ll send you some documents about your appeal before the hearing, like ten days out or more. You can present your case and ask questions if you show up.\n\nThere\u2019s always important folks at the hearing like judges, locals from the authority, maybe some witnesses, and a clerk. If you need it, you can even ask for an interpreter, and they\u2019ll help out, but they won\u2019t give legal advice, so keep that in mind.\n\nIf you\u2019re outside the UK and you want to do the whole evidence thing by video or audio, let the tribunal know early. \n\nAnd after all this, you might be able to claim some travel expenses to get to the hearing. You\u2019ll get your decision letter usually within ten working days after the hearing.\n\nIf you win, the local authority has to do what the tribunal decided, and there are certain deadlines for that. Like if they need to start an assessment, it\u2019s two weeks, and for making that EHC plan, it\u2019s five weeks. But if you lose, you still have options to look into like setting aside the decision or asking for it to be reviewed if there\u2019s been a mistake.\n\nYou even have a way to appeal to the Upper Tribunal if you think things were illegal or just wrong. There\u2019s a whole bunch of laws and rules that the tribunal looks at, so it can get pretty complicated. But yeah, it\u2019s a lot of info all at once, so just take it slow and piece by piece when you're figuring this stuff out.",

It's all about whether you or your partner get Child Benefit, or if someone else is getting it for a kid who lives with you - and they need to be helping out with the kid's stuff too, you know? And it doesn't even matter if the kid isn\u2019t yours, it's all good.\n\nSo the first thing you gotta know is what counts as income. You gotta figure out your 'adjusted net income' which sounds fancy but is just your income before the deductions \u2013 and no Gift Aid stuff here! It's basically everything taxable, like interest from money you save and any dividends from stocks.\n\nThere's a calculator for this Child Benefit tax thing that might help you figure stuff out. Pretty useful, right?\n\nNow, if both you and your partner are making more than that cash, whoever\u2019s making more has to handle the tax charge. Oh, and partner means someone you\u2019re not totally done with - like, if you're married, in a civil partnership, or just living together.\n\nIf you find out your income's over the limit, you can either keep getting your Child Benefit and, like, pay the tax charge later on, or you can just not get the money and skip the charge altogether. But if you go the route of not getting the money, make sure you still fill out the claim form to help with some National Insurance credits for your future State Pension and stuff like that. And also, if your kid needs a National Insurance number, you can do it without them having to ask for it until they\u2019re like 16 or something.\n\nIf you're already cashing in those payments, you can still choose to stop or just carry on and deal with the tax nonsense at the end of the tax year. You gotta pay up if it turns out you owe money, so make sure you sign up for Self Assessment and fill out that return thing each year to avoid fines or whatever.\n\nOh, and if you can't get hold of your partner or ex about their income, you can bug HMRC for a yes or no answer about their Child Benefit status. You can't get their details, though, just that yes or no. Just write them a letter with your info, like your name and your income and stuff.\n\nIf you decide you wanna opt out of getting the Child Benefit payments, you can do that online or fill out a form, or just call them up. But if someone's already using the payments to pay back stuff they owe, you can't opt out.\n\nAfter opting out, just remember you still have to pay any charges from when you got payments. It\u2019s a bit gnarly, but you gotta keep reporting changes in your family life that affect what you\u2019re entitled to, even if you\u2019re not getting the benefit.\n\nWhen you feel like jumping back into the Child Benefit payments, it\u2019s easy. Just start the same way - like, online or fill out a form, they\u2019ll sort it out, but it can take a bit, like up to 28 days for you to actually see any cash flow again.\n\nIf you have any changes, like if your income drops below the threshold, you can opt-out or start getting the benefits again anytime. Just give HMRC a heads up if you don\u2019t have to do the forms anymore. If you have a new kid, definitely claim that benefit - it helps with National Insurance credits and some other stuff like lower child maintenance or something.\n\nIf your partner moves in or out, things can change too, especially regarding those income levels. Whoever's making more has to deal with the charge after any changes in living situations. And remember, small separations like a short trip or staying in the hospital don\u2019t count as breaking up, so keep that in mind!",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, if you\u2019ve got a kid with a disability, your local council can help you out a bit or a lot with all sorts of stuff. They\u2019ve got these things called short break services, which is like some time off for you, and holiday play schemes to keep your kid entertained. They can help with care at home and also give you some aids or changes you might need, plus maybe some financial help for stuff like travel costs to the hospital or whatever. \n\nSo, they\u2019re obligated to do this under some law called the Children Act of 1989. Some of these services are free, but the council may want a bit of cash from you for others, which is kinda fair.\n\nIf you think your child might fit into this aid program, just hit up the social services at your council\u2019s office - you can find them online, it\u2019s pretty easy. They\u2019ll have a social worker chat with you about what you and your kid need, like health stuff, social services, and even how your child\u2019s doing in school. This chat thing is called a \u2018needs assessment\u2019, and at the end, they\u2019ll give you some advice about next steps, which is cool.\n\nOh, and speaking of cool, ask them about support groups too, because those can really help if you\u2019re dealing with a disabled kid \u2013 trust me!\n\nNow about costs \u2013 if your kid gets the services from the council, you could get something called direct payments, which is where they just give you money directly so you can pick and choose the services you want instead of just what the council hands you, which is nice.\n\nAnd, there\u2019s also this Child Tax Credit thing you might get for each disabled kid you take care of, plus there\u2019s Disability Living Allowance for kids, which sounds important too!\n\nIf you don\u2019t make a lot of money, you might qualify for a Family Fund grant, which can help grab some basics like furniture, clothes, toys, or even fun days out or vacations. They\u2019ll look at your money stuff to see if you can get cash from them, which is totally worth checking out on their website, like it\u2019s super easy to find. You can even call them up during the week if you want to ask questions.\n\nOkay, so more about childcare \u2013 the Family Info Service from the council can help you find where to get childcare around you. That\u2019s handy, right? They\u2019ve got info about other stuff too for your kid\u2019s needs.\n\nBy the way, all kids who are 3 or 4 get 15 free hours of education for about 38 weeks a year, which is a really good deal. Some 2-year-olds might even snag free education if they have certain things, like a health plan or are getting that Disability Living Allowance.\n\nIf you\u2019re working, there\u2019s something called Tax-Free Childcare where you could get up to \u00a34,000 a year to help out with costs for a disabled kid\u2019s childcare, which is a lifesaver.\n\nAnd when it comes to education, there\u2019s a law called the Equality Act 2010 that says schools can\u2019t treat disabled kids unfairly. Like, they can\u2019t say \u201cno\u201d to a disabled child wanting to go to school just because they\u2019re disabled. \n\nSchools gotta make \u2018reasonable adjustments\u2019 too, like putting in ramps or changing how kids get assessed or giving extra help when needed, otherwise that\u2019s just not cool.\n\nIf your kid has special educational needs because of their disabilities, you can ask your council for this education health and care assessment, which results in an EHC plan that tells everyone what extra help they need. The school has to help when the council says so, and you can ask to see what support your child can get.\n\nLastly, if you wanna lease a car for your child, the Motability Scheme is a thing. If your kid is over 3 and on certain benefits, like the higher mobility component of Disability Living Allowance, you\u2019re golden for getting a car. Definitely check out the Motability website for more info.\n\nIf you need your home changed to fit your child\u2019s needs, there\u2019s a Disabled Facilities Grant that can help with money for that. Usually, an occupational therapist talks to you about what\u2019s needed, so they\u2019ll help figure it out.\n\nAnd yeah, don\u2019t worry \u2013 getting this grant doesn\u2019t mess up any benefits you\u2019re already getting. So, that\u2019s a win!",

This assistance might encompass, but is not limited to, extremely versatile offerings such as short respite intervals, recreational play gatherings on holidays, domestic supportive care, various assistive technologies, and some monetary contributions meant for travel expenses related to physician appointments and hospital visits!!! It's so complex and convoluted!!!"

I mean, it's pretty straightforward, right? \n\nFirst off, if you wanna contact your closest Jobcentre Plus, just use their local office search thingy (there's a link somewhere). The address is on any letters they sent you too. If you're in Northern Ireland, you gotta talk to the Jobs and Benefits office for JSA and Income Support - confusing, I know. And, oh, if it\u2019s about ESA, there\u2019s a different centre for that.\n\nGot a complaint about Jobcentre Plus? No great surprises there! You can just complain about their service if you feel like it. Of course, there\u2019s a way to do that; it\u2019s all in their complaints procedure thingy.\n\nAnd if you're looking for a job, they have this service called 'Find a job' - used to be called Universal Jobmatch but they changed the name.' \n\nNeed a National Insurance number? You can either apply or, like, find it if you lost it. Just look for that link talking about National Insurance numbers.\n\nSo if you\u2019re an employer? Yeah, you can advertise jobs with them or check out their recruitment stuff. They\u2019ve got your back! \n\nNow, about new benefit claims. You can totally apply online for this New Style JSA thing. But hey, if you\u2019re under 18 or doing it for someone else, you might need to call them instead. Speaking of calling, here\u2019s the number: 0800 055 6688. You can text or use some relay service if you can\u2019t hear or whatever, so they got that figured out. \n\nAnd, you know, if you live in Northern Ireland, call that special Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance number instead - it\u2019s also on their site, pretty easy to find.\n\nOh! And if you're still waiting for something regarding your existing claims, you gotta remember to have your National Insurance number handy when you call, or they might just put you on hold forever!\n\nIf you\u2019re dealing with JSA, Income Support, or ESA, you call this other number: 0800 169 0310 and, like, you can use the same relay stuff as before.\n\nFor Universal Credit questions, just log into your account, and you\u2019re good; there's a helpline if that\u2019s too hard for you. All this is, like, from Monday to Friday during pretty standard hours.\n\nAlso, like, if you need to change or cancel appointments? Just hop onto your account for those Universal Credit appointments. It's basically the same process, and if you're dealing with other appointments, just ring a different number which is 0800 169 0190. \n\nAnd if you want stuff in a different format like braille or large print, yeah, just call them and ask. That's easy enough. If you\u2019re confused, don't feel bad, just call them, they can clear things up. It\u2019s all pretty simple, honestly!",

Only the person claiming the Child Benefit can do this, so don't forget that. \n\nIf you already told them and you're waiting for them to get back to you, you can, uh, check how long it\u2019s gonna take. Just follow the link, it\u2019s easy peasy.\n\nYou should definitely tell HMRC if your kid starts getting Universal Credit or Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance or whatever, or if they change their name (like, by deed poll, which sounds super official). Also important if they get hitched or move in with someone, or, you know, if they just disappear, that\u2019s kinda a big deal.\n\nNow, if your kid drops out of school or training, their Child Benefit will stop after they turn 16, like on August 31st or something. But if they stick around in education or leave it later, you gotta let HMRC know, for real.\n\nIf your kid is moving out or something, you need to tell HMRC if they\u2019re living away for more than 8 weeks and, uh, if they're going abroad for over 12 weeks. Also, if they go to Northern Ireland or if, like, they go to jail for more than 8 weeks too.\n\nIf they end up in hospital or care for a while, make sure to report that if it\u2019s over 8 weeks for care or 12 weeks for hospital. \n\nOh, and about gender stuff! If your kid gets a Gender Recognition Certificate, they usually tell HMRC themselves, but if they haven\u2019t made it official, then no worries, you don\u2019t need to say anything.\n\nIf the worst happens and your kid dies, yes, tell HMRC about that as well. \n\nThere are other ways to tell HMRC about changes too. You can call them up or just write a letter if you\u2019re into that. \n\nYou really gotta keep HMRC updated about anything that changes in your life that might mess with your Child Benefit. If you don\u2019t report changes\u2014like moving or if your immigration status shifts\u2014it might confuse everything and they might stop your payments if they can\u2019t find you!\n\nIf you start making over \u00a360,000, then you might get hit with a High Income Child Benefit Charge, fun times. Even if you\u2019re not getting Child Benefit anymore because of that, still gotta tell them. \n\nDon\u2019t forget to tell them if your bank account changes too! You can log in and do it online; super easy, just use your ID like a passport. Oh, and there\u2019s an app too, if you\u2019re into apps.\n\nIf you change your name or gender for any reason, you gotta tell HMRC about that, too, just so they know.\n\nIf you\u2019re suddenly caring for another kid\u2014like if you have a baby or something\u2014don\u2019t forget to make a new claim for Child Benefit. You can also reach out if you\u2019re getting paid to look after someone else's kid.\n\nAnd if you're all moving in with a partner who claims it as well, that's a thing, too. You get different amounts based on who\u2019s the oldest kid and all that, so don\u2019t double claim or you might owe money back later.\n\nIf you're heading abroad, tell them too! More than 8 weeks gone and you should say something. It's a big deal if you're military and moving for a posting too. \n\nAnd yeah, if something tragic happens with one of the parents, that\u2019s another thing to report.  \n\nJust remember, reach out to HMRC anytime things get weird! You can call or write, and they'll help you out.",

Either:\n\n  * your husband, wife or partner can [apply to transfer the credits](/government/publications/national-insurance-credits-for-parents-and-carers-cf411a)\n  * a different family member who provides care for your child can [apply for Specified Adult Childcare credits](/government/publications/national-insurance-credits-for-adults-who-care-for-a-child-under-12-fact-sheet/specified-adult-childcare-credits-fact-sheet)\n\n\n\n## If your circumstances change\n\nYou must [report any change of circumstances](/report-changes-child-benefit) to the Child Benefit Office.\n\n## What you'll get \n\nThere are 2 Child Benefit rates.\n\nWho the allowance is for | Rate (weekly)  \n---|---  \nEldest or only child | \u00a325.60  \nAdditional children | \u00a316.95 per child  \n  \nYou must [contact the Child Benefit Office](/contact/hm-revenue-customs/child-benefit) if you\u2019re paid too much or too little.\n\nAny Child Benefit payments you get will count towards the [benefit cap](/benefit-cap). If you\u2019re affected by the cap, you\u2019ll still get the full amount for your Child Benefit payments but your other benefits may be reduced.\n\n## If families split up\n\nIf a family splits up, you get \u00a325.60 a week for the eldest child.\n\nIf you have 2 children and one lives with you and the other lives with  \nsomeone else (for example, your ex-partner), you\u2019ll each get \u00a325.60 a week.\n\nIf you both claim for the same child, only one of you will get Child Benefit for them.\n\nIf you\u2019re entitled to Child Benefit for any other children, you\u2019ll get \u00a316.95 for each child.\n\n## If families join together\n\nIf you move in with a partner who also claims Child Benefit, you get \u00a325.60 for the eldest child in the household. You get \u00a316.95 for any younger children.\n\nYou and your partner can claim for different children. If you live together, you cannot both claim at the higher rate - you may have to pay back some of the money if you do.\n\nYou must [report the change to your family circumstances](/government/publications/child-benefit-change-of-family-circumstances).\n\n## If you or your partner earn over \u00a360,000\n\nIf either your or your partner\u2019s \u2018adjusted net income\u2019 is over \u00a360,000 a year, you may have to pay the [High Income Child Benefit Charge](/child-benefit-tax-charge).\n\nYour adjusted net income is your total [taxable income](/income-tax) before any personal allowances and less things like Gift Aid. Your total taxable income includes interest from savings and dividends.\n\nIf you have to pay the charge, you can still get the other advantages of Child Benefit like National Insurance credits. The charge will not be more than the amount you get from the Child Benefit payments.\n\nWork out if your adjusted net income is over \u00a360,000 using the [Child Benefit tax calculator](/child-benefit-tax-calculator).

      "poorly_written_article": "So, okay, let\u2019s talk about Child Benefit, right? You can totally get it if you\u2019re taking care of a kid who's under like 16, or under 20 if they\u2019re in some kind of approved school or training or whatever. You only need one person to claim for a kid, which is kinda wild, cause there\u2019s no cap on how many kids you can get it for, y\u2019know? \n\nSo basically, when you\u2019re signed up for Child Benefit, you get some cash every four weeks for each kid. There\u2019s also this thing called National Insurance credits that help with your State Pension stuff, which is super important. Kids also get a National Insurance number, usually just before they turn 16, which is neat since you don\u2019t have to ask for it.\n\nOh, and even if you don\u2019t want the actual money, it\u2019s smart to apply so you still get the other perks. You get National Insurance credits automatically if you have a kid under 12, which is great cause it fills gaps if you\u2019re not working or just not earning enough. So even if you're not working, someone else in your family, like your partner, can still nab those credits.\n\nNow, like, if anything changes in your life, you\u2019ve gotta tell the Child Benefit Office. Otherwise, they don't know what's up! And about the money? There are two rates, so, for your eldest or only child, it's like \u00a325.60 weekly, and for each additional kid, it\u2019s \u00a316.95. If you mess up and get too much or too little, definitely reach out to the Child Benefit Office to sort it out.\n\nIf a couple splits, you still get \u00a325.60 a week for the eldest but if you both claim for the same kid, just one of you will get it. And if you're one of those families that join together, you\u2019ll get the same rates but just would have to keep track of what\u2019s happening with your claims.\n\nAlso, super important\u2014if your or your partner's income is over \u00a360,000, you might need to pay this High Income Child Benefit Charge, which can totally mess with your money. Either of you can deal with the charge, but if you hit \u00a380,000, bam! You won\u2019t see the extra Child Benefit at all because they\u2019ll just take it back.\n\nPayments are typically given every four weeks, but if you\u2019re a single parent or getting some benefits, you could get it weekly. And you can pick where the cash goes, but only to one account. If you\u2019re living in the UK, you usually qualify if you\u2019re responsible for the child and they\u2019re under 16.\n\nOh, and if your kid is like 16 or older, you could still get benefits if they\u2019re in school, but you gotta keep an eye on that to keep getting money. Fostering or adopting a child? No problem, just keep the council out of your business, and you can claim Child Benefit immediately. \n\nIf you help look after someone else's kid, you know, like a friend\u2019s or family\u2019s, you could maybe get Child Benefit there too, but check with the office since rules are all over the place. No duplicate claims allowed, though! \n\nMoving abroad? You can still get Child Benefit, but only in specific cases. If you've settled status under the EU rules or pre-settled status and are working, you can claim too. All this requires proof and whatnot.\n\nOnce your kid enters the workforce or scores certain benefits, you\u2019ll stop getting that Child Benefit\u2014just FYI. And when you\u2019re ready to claim, do it anyway after registering the birth of your child\u2014seriously, it can go back three months. \n\nDecide who claims the Child Benefit between you and your partner \u2018cause whoever does will snag those National Insurance credits. You can only get higher rates for the eldest in the house\u2014reducing claims is a must!\n\nOnline claims are best, but if you can\u2019t get it that way, you can still do it by post or phone. And always keep the Child Benefit Office in the loop about any changes in your life to avoid issues. Got complaints? Lodge them with the office, man! Good luck with your claims!",

You might also be eligible if you have difficulty getting around because of a cognitive or mental health condition, like anxiety.\n\n### How difficulty with tasks is assessed\n\nThe Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will assess how difficult you find daily living and mobility tasks. For each task they\u2019ll look at:\n\n  * whether you can do it safely\n  * how long it takes you\n  * how often your condition affects this activity\n  * whether you need help to do it, from a person or using extra equipment\n\n\n\nYour carer could get [Carer\u2019s Allowance](https://www.gov.uk/carers-allowance) if you have substantial caring needs.\n\n## Help with PIP\n\nIf you need help understanding or applying for PIP you can:\n\n  * [get help from Citizens Advice](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/sick-or-disabled-people-and-carers/pip/)\n  * watch [PIP video guides with British Sign Language](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC0aQWFFHARy_lYZbrnJfuXzhKWotacfM)\n  * use [easy read guides which explain PIP](/government/publications/about-pip-what-it-is-and-how-to-claim-it-easy-read-guide)\n\n\n\n## If you live in Scotland\n\nYou need to [apply for Adult Disability Payment (ADP)](https://www.mygov.scot/adult-disability-payment) instead of PIP.\n\nIf you currently get PIP, you\u2019ll be automatically moved to ADP by spring 2025.\n\nWhen the move begins, you\u2019ll get letters from DWP and Social Security Scotland.

You do not need to do anything until DWP writes to you about your DLA unless your circumstances change.\n\n## Eligibility \n\nYou can get Personal Independence Payment (PIP) if all of the following apply to you:\n\n  * you\u2019re 16 or over\n  * you have a long-term physical or mental health condition or disability\n  * you have [difficulty doing certain everyday tasks or getting around](/PIP)\n  * you expect the difficulties to last for at least 12 months from when they started\n\n\n\nYou must also be under [State Pension age](/state-pension-age) if you\u2019ve not received PIP before.\n\nIf you live in Scotland, you need to [apply for Adult Disability Payment (ADP)](https://www.mygov.scot/adult-disability-payment) instead.\n\nIf you\u2019re over State Pension age, you can apply for [Attendance Allowance](/attendance-allowance) instead. Or if you\u2019ve received PIP before, you can still make a new claim if you were eligible for it in the year before you reached State Pension age.\n\nThere are different eligibility rules [if you\u2019re nearing the end of life](/pip/claiming-end-of-life) (for example, due to a life-limiting illness). You might be able to get PIP more quickly and at a higher rate.\n\n## If you get other benefits or income\n\nYou can get PIP at the same time as all other benefits, except [Armed Forces Independence Payment](/claim-for-injury-received-while-serving/armed-forces-independence-payment-afip).\n\nIf you get [Constant Attendance Allowance](/constant-attendance-allowance) you\u2019ll get less of the daily living part of PIP.\n\nIf you get [War Pensioners\u2019 Mobility Supplement](/guidance/war-pension-scheme-mobility-supplement-wpms) you will not get the mobility part of PIP.\n\nYou can get PIP if you\u2019re working or have savings.\n\n## If you\u2019ve recently returned from living abroad\n\nTo apply for PIP, you usually need to:\n\n  * have lived in England, Scotland or Wales for at least 2 of the last 3 years\n  * be living in one of these countries when you apply\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve recently returned from living in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein, you might be able to get PIP sooner.\n\n[Find out about PIP if you live in Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/personal-independence-payment).\n\n## If you live abroad\n\nYou might still be able to get PIP if you either:\n\n  * live in the [EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein](/claim-benefits-abroad/disability-benefits) \\- you can only get help with daily living tasks\n  * work in the Armed Forces, or are a family member of someone who does\n\n\n\n## If you\u2019re not a British citizen\n\nYou must:\n\n  * normally live in or show that you intend to settle in the UK, Ireland, the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands\n  * not be subject to [immigration control](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/immigration/non-eea-nationals-and-the-habitual-residence-test/are-you-subject-to-immigration-control/) (unless you\u2019re a sponsored immigrant)\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re from the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein, you and your family usually also need settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme to get PIP.

[Check if you can still apply to the EU Settlement Scheme](/settled-status-eu-citizens-families/who-can-apply).\n\nYou might still be able to get PIP if you\u2019re a refugee or have humanitarian protection status.\n\n## How much you\u2019ll get \n\nHow much Personal Independence Payment (PIP) you get depends on how difficult you find:\n\n  * everyday activities (\u2018daily living\u2019 tasks)\n  * getting around (\u2018mobility\u2019 tasks)\n\n\n\nFind out [what tasks count as daily living and mobility tasks](/PIP).\n\n##  PIP amounts\n\n| Lower weekly rate | Higher weekly rate  \n---|---|---  \nDaily living part | \u00a372.65 | \u00a3108.55  \nMobility part | \u00a328.70 | \u00a375.75  \n  \nPIP is tax free.

      "poorly_written_article": "So like, this thing called Personal Independence Payment (or PIP, for short) is some cash help for folks who have long-term health problems. You know, like if you can\u2019t do your daily stuff or you have a tough time moving around. You can still get it if you work or have some savings, which is cool, right? Even if you\u2019re getting other benefits, you can get PIP too. Oh, and there\u2019s some stuff about it in Welsh if that\u2019s your jam.\n\nOkay, so PIP has two parts\u2014the daily living part, which is for help with everyday tasks, and the mobility part for those who need help getting around. It depends on how tough things are for you with your daily stuff and moving. If you\u2019re kind of at the end of your life because of a sickness, you automatically get the daily living part, which is kinda sweet, I guess. But the mobility part depends on what you need or whatever.\n\nSo, the daily living part, right? You might get some cash if you struggle with things like cooking up meals, eating and drinking (yeah, that\u2019s pretty important!), keeping track of meds, all that wash-up stuff, using the bathroom, getting dressed, reading, managing your money (don\u2019t spend it all at once!), being social, and talking or understanding things. \n\nThen there\u2019s the mobility part. This is for people who can\u2019t figure out how to get around, like following directions or just moving physically and even leaving the house. You don\u2019t even have to be physically disabled; if your brain just isn\u2019t cooperating, like with anxiety, you can still qualify. \n\nSo, how do they decide how hard these tasks are for you? The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) checks if you can do it safely, how long it takes you, how often your condition messes you up, and if you need help from someone or stuff like, uh, equipment? If you have a carer, they might get some cash too\u2014Carer\u2019s Allowance or something.\n\nIf you\u2019re in Scotland, forget PIP and go for Adult Disability Payment instead. They\u2019re switching folks over by 2025, so keep an eye out for the mail from DWP. \n\nAlso, if you get Disability Living Allowance (DLA), which is getting phased out for most adults, you keep it if you\u2019re under 16 or were born before 1948. If not, they\u2019ll nudge you to apply for PIP later.  \n\nEligibility for PIP is pretty straightforward\u2014you gotta be 16+, have that long-term condition or disability and expect it to stick around for at least a year. And if you\u2019re totally spent by the time you\u2019re at state pension age, you can look into Attendance Allowance.\n\nYou can get PIP while you have other benefits, except for that Armed Forces Independence Payment thing. If you\u2019ve just come back from living abroad, you\u2019ve gotta have lived in the UK for like, 2 of the past 3 years to qualify, but if you\u2019re coming back from the EU or nearby places, it might happen sooner. \n\nIf you\u2019re not even a British citizen, well, you need to live here, or plan to settle here, and not be under immigration control. Plus, if you\u2019re from the EU or those other countries, you usually need to have settled status to get PIP. And yeah, you can still apply if you\u2019re a refugee. \n\nNow, about the cash\u2014PIP gives you a weekly rate, lower or higher depending on how much help you need with daily stuff and getting around. It\u2019s tax-free, just to remind ya, and your income or savings don\u2019t affect how much you get. \n\nPIP payments usually happen every 4 weeks, and your letter will let you know when to expect it and all that jazz. If you ever change your situation, like if your health gets better or worse, you gotta let them know or it could be a big ol\u2019 mess.\n\nIf you need help with the whole PIP thing, you can hit up Citizens Advice, watch some videos, or check out easy read guides\u2014they\u2019re pretty much what they sound like. If you get the mobility cash, look into getting a Blue Badge for parking or something.\n\nStarting your claim can be done by phone\u2014just call and they\u2019ll send you a form, or you can mail them a free post letter, but that takes longer. And don\u2019t forget to include any medical info that can help your case! \n\nIf they need more info, you might have to go to an assessment to see how your condition affects you\u2014either in person, over the phone or via video call. If they don't agree with your claim, you can ask for a mandatory reconsideration, which sounds fancy, but it just means you want them to take another look at it.  \n\nSo yeah, I guess that\u2019s the long and short of it about PIP. Just remember to keep all the papers in check and report any changes quickly to avoid hassles!",

      "body": "## Overview \n\nYou may get a county court judgment (CCJ) or high court judgment if someone takes court action against you (saying you owe them money) and you do not respond.\n\nYou must [respond to the court claim](/respond-to-court-claim-for-money) by the date on the email or letter you receive.\n\nIf you get a judgment, this means that the court has formally decided that you owe the money.\n\nThe judgment will come in the post and will explain:\n\n  * how much you owe\n  * how to pay (in full or in instalments)\n  * the deadline for paying\n  * who to pay\n\n\n\n[Records of judgments](/county-court-judgments-ccj-for-debt/ccjs-and-your-credit-rating) are kept for 6 years unless you pay the full amount within a month - this can make it hard to get credit.\n\n## What you can do if you get a judgment\n\nIf you do owe the money, you\u2019ll need to pay it back. If you cannot afford to, you can ask to:\n\n  * change the terms of (\u2018vary\u2019) the judgment\n  * pay it back in instalments\n\n\n\nFind out what [options you have for paying the judgment](/county-court-judgments-ccj-for-debt/pay-the-judgment-if-you-do-owe-the-money).\n\nYou can apply for the judgment to be cancelled (or \u2018set aside\u2019) if:\n\n  * you do not owe the money\n  * you did not receive, or did not respond to, the original claim from the court saying you owed the money\n\n\n\nFind out [how to apply for the judgment to be cancelled](/county-court-judgments-ccj-for-debt/cancel-the-judgment).\n\nIf you get a judgment, do not ignore it - you could be taken back to court and forced to pay.\n\n## Court judgments for debt in Scotland\n\nThe law is different in Scotland - read [guidance from the Accountant in Bankruptcy](https://www.aib.gov.uk/) (Scotland\u2019s insolvency service).\n\n## Pay the judgment - if you do owe the money \n\nYou\u2019ll have to pay the person or business you owe the money to, or their solicitor. The name and address will be on the judgment form. Do not pay the court.\n\nMake sure you can prove you\u2019ve paid. Send a cheque or postal order by post, or make a bank transfer. Do not send cash through the post.\n\nKeep a record of your payments and make sure you pay in time.\n\n## Pay in instalments\n\nIf you\u2019re paying in instalments, ask the person or business you owe the money to about the best way to pay.\n\nYou may want to set up a standing order to pay the money directly from your bank account.\n\nIf you\u2019re late with your payments, you could be taken back to court and you may have to pay extra costs.\n\n## Ask to change the payments\n\nYou can ask to change the terms of the judgment - for example, how and when you pay.\n\nTo do this, fill in the [N245 application form](/government/publications/form-n245-application-for-suspension-of-a-warrant-and-or-variation-of-an-order).\n\nGive details of your income and spending, and say how much you can realistically afford to pay.\n\nYou may have to pay a [court fee](/court-fees-what-they-are).\n\nIf your offer is rejected, the court will decide on the amount you have to pay.\n\n## If you do not pay what the court has ordered\n\nIf you do not pay as ordered, the person or business you owe money to may:\n\n  * threaten you with bailiffs to collect the money\n  * ask the court to take action against you to force you to pay\n\n\n\nYou can get temporary protection from your creditors through the [\u2018Breathing Space\u2019 scheme](/options-for-paying-off-your-debts/breathing-space), while still making repayments. You\u2019ll need to apply through a debt adviser.\n\n### If you\u2019re threatened with bailiffs\n\nThe person or business you owe money to may use bailiffs to collect the money.\n\nThey\u2019ll have to apply to the court for a \u2018warrant\u2019, which will give the bailiff the right to visit your home or property. You\u2019ll be given 7 days to pay before they visit.\n\nYou may be able to stop the bailiff from visiting, by filling in the [N245 application form](/government/publications/form-n245-application-for-suspension-of-a-warrant-and-or-variation-of-an-order).\n\nSay on the form how you\u2019ll repay the money - for example weekly or monthly payments. If your offer is accepted, the warrant will be stopped as long as you keep up with the payments.\n\n### Actions the court can take against you to force you to pay\n\nThe court may decide to:\n\n  * order a deduction from your earnings\n  * freeze money in your bank or building society account\n  * deduct the money you owe when you sell your property (such as a house, land, stocks or shares)\n  * order you to come to court to answer questions about things like your earnings or employment status\n\n\n\n## If you have other judgments or debts\n\nIf you have another judgment against you, you can arrange to pay all your debts to the court in a single weekly or monthly payment.\n\nThis will stop people taking action against you to get their money - for example by sending bailiffs to your home.\n\nYou can only do this if your total debts are under \u00a35,000.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to fill in the [application for an administration order (N92)](/government/publications/form-n92-application-for-an-administration-order).\n\nContact the court if you cannot keep up with the payments.\n\n## Cancel the judgment \n\nIf you do not owe the money, you can ask the court to cancel the county court judgment (CCJ) or high court judgment. This is known as getting the judgment \u2018set aside\u2019.\n\nYou can also do this if you did not receive, or did not respond to, the original claim from the court saying you owed the money.\n\n## Apply to get the judgment set aside\n\nTo get a judgment set aside, fill in the [application notice (N244)](/government/publications/form-n244-application-notice) and send it to the court.\n\nYou may have to pay a [court fee](/court-fees-what-they-are) of \u00a3303.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to go to a private hearing at the court to explain why you do not owe the money.\n\nIf you do not go to the hearing, your application will be rejected and you\u2019ll have to pay the amount in the judgment.\n\n## CCJs and your credit rating \n\nIf you get a county court judgment (CCJ) or a high court judgment, it will stay on the Register of Judgments, Orders and Fines for 6 years.\n\nBanks and loan companies use this information to decide whether to give you credit or loans.\n\n## If you pay within one month\n\nIf you pay the full amount within one month, you can get the judgment removed from the register.\n\nWrite to the court to say you\u2019ve paid. You\u2019ll need to send proof of payment from the person or business you owed money to.\n\n## If you pay after one month\n\nIf you pay after one month, you can get the record of the judgment marked as \u2018satisfied\u2019 in the register.\n\nIt will stay on the register for 6 years but people searching the register will see that you\u2019ve paid.\n\nWrite to the court to say you\u2019ve paid. You\u2019ll need to send proof of payment from the person or business you owed money to.\n\n## Getting a certificate of cancellation or satisfaction\n\nIf you want proof from the court that you\u2019ve paid, you can apply for:\n\n  * a certificate of cancellation - if you paid within one month\n  * a certificate of satisfaction - if you paid after one month\n\n\n\nApply for the certificate in writing or by [sending form N443](/government/publications/form-n443-application-for-a-certificate-of-satisfaction-or-cancellation) to the court that is dealing with your case.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to include a cheque for \u00a315 - make it payable to \u2018HMCTS\u2019. If you want to pay by card, contact the court that\u2019s handling your case.\n\n### If you cannot get proof of payment\n\nIf you cannot get proof from the person or business you owed money to, you can still apply for a certificate of cancellation or satisfaction using form N443.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to send evidence to the court showing you made the payment, for example a bank statement. If you do not have evidence, explain this on the form.\n\nThe court will write to the person or business you owed money to. If they do not respond within 30 days, the court will use your evidence to make a decision.\n\n## Search the register of judgments\n\nYou can search for details of any judgments against you on the [register of judgments](http://www.trustonline.org.uk).\n\nYou\u2019ll have to pay a small fee - each search costs between \u00a36 and \u00a310.\n\nIf the information on the register is wrong, [contact the court](https://www.gov.uk/find-court-tribunal) where the judgment was made.\n  *[CCJ]: county court judgment\n  *[HMCTS]: HM Courts & Tribunals Service",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, like, if someone\u2019s taking you to court and says you owe them cash and you just ignore it, you could get a CCJ or high court judgment. Basically, you totally need to reply to the court by whatever date they put in the letter or email, or else the court might side with the person. \n\nWhen they send you the judgment in the mail, it\u2019ll lay out some stuff like how much you gotta pay, the payment method (could be all at once or in pieces), when it\u2019s due, and who to send the money to. Pretty important! If you don\u2019t pay up right away or if you miss the deadline, this judgment sticks around for like six years unless you cough up the whole amount in a month, which is kinda huge because it messes with your credit, ya know? \n\nNow, if you do owe the money, obviously pay it back. But if you\u2019re in a tight spot and can\u2019t afford it, you can totally ask to change the payment plan or split it into smaller payments over time. So, like, make sure you know what your options are with paying this off. \n\nAlso, if you really didn't owe the money or just never saw that first court thing, there\u2019s a way to ask them to re-evaluate the judgment, so you can cancel it \u2013 that's like \"set it aside\" or whatever. You have to fill out this form,\n which sounds kinda boring. Just don\u2019t ignore that court judgement \u2013 it could mean another trip to court and more money outta your pocket, not fun! \n\nIf you\u2019re in Scotland, though, things are different, so check the local rules or something.  \n\nWhen it comes to paying who you owe, you need to send payments directly to the person or company or their lawyer written on the judgment. Don\u2019t send it to the court! If you\u2019re paying by check or something, make sure you keep proof of your payments because you wanna make sure they can\u2019t come back and say you didn\u2019t pay. \n\nIf it\u2019s easier, maybe set up a standing order with your bank to avoid late payments, cause you probably don\u2019t want that drama of getting taken back to court again. Speaking of which, if you mess up the whole payment thing, the person you owe might threaten you with bailiffs or ask the court to step in to make you pay. It's like, who needs that!?  \n\nOh, and if the creditor gets bailiffs after you, they have to get a warrant first, which gives you a heads up for about a week before they show up. If you don\u2019t want them knocking at your door, fill out the N245 form to try and get a payment plan sorted out. If they accept it and you keep paying, the whole bailiff situation goes away, which sounds good, right?\n \nAnd if you have multiple debts, you can bundle \u2018em under one payment plan as long as it\u2019s under five grand and fill out another form (N92). Plus, if you\u2019re really in deep and need the judgment canceled, fill out the N244 form and head over to court to explain your side. Don\u2019t forget there might be a fee, so keep that in mind! \n\nSo, like, getting a CCJ or anything on your record is not cool and it stays for six years. Some banks will think twice about giving you loans if they see you're in the judgment club. If you manage to pay off the full amount within a month, let the court know and they\u2019ll scrub that judgment off your record like it never happened. But if it\u2019s past that month, it gets marked as paid but still stays there for six years. You\u2019ve got to write to the court to confirm you paid up either way, so keep those receipts!\n\nYou can even request a formal \"hey, I paid this\" notice or whatever (a certificate) to show you settled things. If you don\u2019t have proof, you can still try getting that certificate by showing what you can. Just crossed fingers the court agrees as they might have to contact the creditor, and you could be waiting. \n\nLastly, you can peek at the register of judgments to see what\u2019s affecting you, but there\u2019s a small fee for that! If you find something wrong, definitely reach out to the court about any issues. \n\nPhew! That\u2019s a lot, huh? Just be careful with those debts and judgments!",

      "body": "## What you can do when a bailiff visits \n\nA bailiff (\u2018enforcement agent\u2019) may visit your home if you do not pay your debts - such as Council Tax bills, parking fines, court fines and county court, high court or family court judgments.\n\nThis will happen if you ignore letters saying that bailiffs will be used.\n\nThere are different kinds of bailiffs, known as:\n\n  * \u2018certificated enforcement agents\u2019 (also known as \u2018civil enforcement agents\u2019)\n  * \u2018high court enforcement officers\u2019\n  * \u2018county court and family court bailiffs\u2019\n  * bailiffs who enforce magistrates\u2019 court fines and warrants for arrests (either \u2018civilian enforcement officers\u2019 or \u2018Approved Enforcement Agents\u2019)\n\n\n\nA bailiff may also visit your home for other reasons, for example to serve court documents or give notices and summons.\n\nAn Approved Enforcement Agent can arrest you if there\u2019s a warrant for your arrest for breaking a community penalty order.\n\nBailiffs must usually give you at least 7 days\u2019 notice of their first visit.\n\nThere\u2019s a different process in [Scotland](https://www.mygov.scot/your-rights-sheriff-officers/).\n\n## Pay what you owe before a bailiff visits\n\nIf you think a bailiff might visit you to collect debts, you can stop this by paying the money you owe. Get advice about how to pay your debt from whoever you owe money to as soon as possible.\n\nFind out [what to do if you have a debt that you cannot pay](/county-court-judgments-ccj-for-debt/if-you-do-owe-the-money-pay-the-judgment).\n\nYou might be arrested if you do not pay criminal debts, such as fines or penalty notices.\n\n## Dealing with bailiffs\n\nYou usually do not have to open your door to a bailiff or let them in.\n\nBailiffs cannot enter your home:\n\n  * by force, for example by pushing past you\n  * if only children under 16 or vulnerable people (with disabilities, for example) are present\n  * between 9pm and 6am\n  * through anything except the door\n\n\n\nBailiffs are allowed to force their way into your home to collect unpaid criminal fines, Income Tax or Stamp Duty, but only as a last resort.\n\nIf you do not let a bailiff in or agree to pay them:\n\n  * they could take things from outside your home, for example your car\n  * you could end up owing even more money\n\n\n\nIf you do let a bailiff in but do not pay them they may take some of your belongings. They could sell the items to pay debts and cover their fees.\n\nYou may be able to get extra time to make a payment or get debt advice [if you\u2019re a vulnerable person](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/debt-and-money/action-your-creditor-can-take/bailiffs/how-bailiffs-should-treat-you/how-bailiffs-should-treat-you-if-youre-vulnerable/) (for example, you have mental health problems or are seriously ill).\n\n## Check the bailiff\u2019s identity\n\nBefore you let a bailiff in to take your things or pay them, ask to see:\n\n  * proof of their identity, such as a badge, ID card or enforcement agent certificate\n  * which company they\u2019re from\n  * a telephone contact number\n  * a detailed breakdown of the amount owed\n\n\n\nYou can ask for proof of a bailiff\u2019s identity and authorisation even if they\u2019ve visited before - for example, ask them to put it through the letterbox or show it at the window.\n\nAll bailiffs must have a certificate unless they\u2019re exempt or they\u2019re with someone who does have a certificate.\n\nAnyone who claims to be a bailiff when they are not is committing fraud.\n\nTo check a bailiff\u2019s identity, find out what kind of bailiff they are from their proof of identity and then:\n\n  * [check the register of certificated bailiffs](http://certificatedbailiffs.justice.gov.uk/) if they say they\u2019re a certificated enforcement agent ([contact the Civil National Business Centre](https://www.find-court-tribunal.service.gov.uk/courts/civil-national-business-centre-cnbc) if you have a question)\n  * [check the list](https://www.hceoa.org.uk/choosing-a-hceo/find-a-member) if they say they\u2019re a high court enforcement officer\n  * [contact the court that sent them](/find-court-tribunal) if they say they\u2019re a county court bailiff, family court bailiff or a civilian enforcement officer\n\n\n\nIf they say they\u2019re an Approved Enforcement Agent, check they\u2019re from one of the following companies:\n\n  * Compliant Data-Led Engagements & Resolutions (CDER) Group\n  * Marston Holdings Limited\n  * Jacobs Enforcement\n  * Excel Civil Enforcement Limited\n  * Swift Credit Services Limited\n\n\n\n## Paying a bailiff\n\nYou can pay the bailiff on the doorstep - you do not have to let them into your home.\n\nMake sure you get a receipt to prove you\u2019ve paid.\n\nIf you cannot pay all the money right away, speak to the bailiff about how you could pay the money back.\n\nOffer to pay what you can afford in weekly or monthly payments.\n\nThe bailiff does not have to accept your offer.\n\n## What bailiffs can and cannot take\n\nIf you let a bailiff into your home, they may take some of your belongings to sell.\n\nBailiffs can take luxury items, for example a TV or games console.\n\nThey cannot take:\n\n  * things you need, such as your clothes, cooker or fridge\n  * work tools and equipment which together are worth less than \u00a31,350\n  * someone else\u2019s belongings, such as your partner\u2019s computer\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll have to prove that someone else\u2019s goods do not belong to you.\n\n## What bailiffs can charge\n\nHow much you pay depends on your situation. Citizens Advice has [information on bailiffs\u2019 fees](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/debt-and-money/action-your-creditor-can-take/bailiffs/bailiffs-fees-and-charges/fees-bailiffs-can-charge/).\n\n## Help or advice\n\nYou can get free help or advice on dealing with bailiffs from:\n\n  * [National Debtline](https://www.nationaldebtline.org/EW/Pages/default.aspx)\n  * [MoneyHelper](https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/money-troubles/dealing-with-debt)\n  * [Citizens Advice](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/debt-and-money/action-your-creditor-can-take/bailiffs/)\n  * [StepChange Debt Charity](http://www.stepchange.org/)\n\n## How to complain about a bailiff \n\nYou can complain about a bailiff (\u2018enforcement agent\u2019) if you think they\u2019ve broken the rules, for example if they:\n\n  * threaten or harass you\n  * try to break into your home without a warrant\n  * try to charge you incorrect fees\n  * take goods belonging to someone else\n  * take essential items, including things you need for work\n\n\n\nYou can complain both to:\n\n  * whoever the bailiff is working for\n  * the people you owe money to\n\n\n\n## Who to complain to\n\nWho you need to complain to depends on whether the bailiff is a:\n\n  * private bailiff - either a certificated enforcement agent (also known as civil enforcement agents) or a high court enforcement officer\n  * county or family court bailiff\n  * a bailiff enforcing magistrates\u2019 court fines (either a civilian enforcement officer or Approved Enforcement Agent)\n\n\n\n## Complain about a private bailiff\n\nMost bailiffs work for private companies, even if they\u2019re collecting money for the council or the government. They can also be directly employed by local authorities, or self-employed.\n\n### If the bailiff is collecting money for a council or Transport for London (TfL)\n\nFirst complain to the council or TfL. If you\u2019re still not happy, you can [complain to the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman](https://www.lgo.org.uk/make-a-complaint).\n\n### Complain to a trade organisation (if the bailiff is a member)\n\nYou may also be able to complain to the bailiff\u2019s trade association if they\u2019re a member.\n\nCheck the membership lists on the trade associations\u2019 websites:\n\n  * [Civil Enforcement Association (CIVEA) - member list](https://www.civea.co.uk/members)\n  * [High Court Enforcement Officers Association (HCEOA) - directory](https://www.hceoa.org.uk/choosing-a-hceo/find-a-member)\n\n\n\nFollow the complaints procedure on the association\u2019s website:\n\n  * [CIVEA](https://www.civea.co.uk/complaints/)\n  * [HCEOA](https://www.hceoa.org.uk/about-us/make-a-complaint)\n\n\n\n### If the bailiff is a high court enforcement officer\n\nIf you have a serious complaint about a high court enforcement officer, you can ask a high court judge to consider whether they should be allowed to continue operating.\n\nYou can complain by writing to:\n\nCivil Enforcement Policy   \nCivil Law and Justice Division   \nMinistry of Justice   \n102 Petty France   \nLondon   \nSW1H 9AJ   \n\n\n### Complain to a court about a bailiff\u2019s behaviour\n\nIf a bailiff has a certificate allowing them to carry out enforcement action (a certificated enforcement agent) you can ask the court to consider whether they should be allowed to continue operating. You need to:\n\n  * [fill out and submit an EAC2 form](/government/publications/form-eac2-complaint-against-a-certificated-person)\n  * send it to the court where the agent is registered - you can find this on the [certificated enforcement register](https://certificatedbailiffs.justice.gov.uk/)\n\n\n\nThe court can remove the agent\u2019s certificate or order them to pay compensation.\n\nIt\u2019s free to make a complaint, but you may have to pay legal costs if you complain to a court and they decide there were no \u2018reasonable grounds\u2019 for the complaint.\n\n## Complain about a court bailiff or civilian enforcement officer\n\nYou can [make a complaint in writing or use the complaint form](/government/organisations/hm-courts-and-tribunals-service/about/complaints-procedure#how-to-complain) if you\u2019re complaining about either:\n\n  * a county or family court bailiff\n  * a civilian enforcement officer\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll need to make the complaint to the court the bailiff has come from. Find out where to send the form by using [court finder](/find-court-tribunal).\n\n## Complain about a bailiff enforcing magistrates\u2019 court fines\n\nIf your complaint is about a privately-employed bailiff collecting a magistrates\u2019 court fine, you should first complain to the firm that employs them. You should also send a copy of your complaint to the court where the warrant was issued.\n\nFind out where to send the complaint by using [court finder](/find-court-tribunal).\n  *[TfL]: Transport for London\n  *[CIVEA]: Civil Enforcement Association\n  *[HCEOA]: High Court Enforcement Officers Association",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, like, if a bailiff, or enforcement agent or whatever, comes knocking on your door, it's probably 'cause you haven't paid your debts, right? Stuff like Council Tax or parking fines or other court stuff. If you totally ignore those letters saying they might show up, well, yeah, they're gonna come at some point. \n\nThere\u2019s a few types of bailiffs, I think they call them certificated enforcement agents or something, and then high court enforcement officers\u2014I mean, maybe you've heard of those. Also, you got your family court bailiffs and ones that do stuff for magistrates' court. Just brand names, I guess? \n\nSometimes, they just show up to deliver court papers or notices. You should know, an Approved Enforcement Agent can even arrest you if there\u2019s a warrant out for your arrest, which kinda sounds intense, honestly. \n\nOh, and they usually gotta give you a heads up, like, at least 7 days before they pop round to your place. But listen, Scotland does this a bit differently, not sure how, but it\u2019s worth knowing!  \n\nNow, if you're thinking a bailiff\u2019s gonna show up, just pay what you owe before that happens. Kinda obvious, right? Call the people you owe and get some tips on how to sort it out quick. If it's criminal debts like fines, yeah, you really don't want to get arrested.  \n\nYou don\u2019t have to answer the door to a bailiff or let them in, like, at all. They can\u2019t break in or anything, which is a relief. Also, if you've got kids or vulnerable people in the house, they can't just barge in. And they can\u2019t show up super late at night or, like, super early in the morning either. \n\nBut, just a heads up, they can force their way in if it\u2019s about those unpaid criminal fines and stuff. And if you ignore them completely? They might snatch up something from outside, like your car, and you'll end up with a bigger bill. Super fun, right? \n\nSo if they do get inside and you don\u2019t pay, they can take your stuff to sell it and pay off your debts, which kinda sucks. Plus, if you\u2019re vulnerable (like, if you\u2019ve got a mental health issue or something), you might be able to get more time to pay or some help. \n\nOh, and before you even think about letting one in, make sure they show you their ID or whatever, like a badge or a card or something that says they\u2019re legit. They gotta prove they\u2019re not just some dude off the street. And if you\u2019re not sure, you can ask them to show it through the door or window\u2014no shame in that!  \n\nYou can pay them right at your doorstep too, which is cool\u2014you don\u2019t have to let them in. Just make sure you grab a receipt so you can prove you gave them money. If you can\u2019t pay the whole amount right away, try to work out a payment plan or something. Doesn\u2019t hurt to ask, though they don\u2019t have to say yes. \n\nAs for what they can take from you\u2014if you let them into your place, they might grab your stuff, like your fancy TV or gaming stuff. But they can\u2019t take your basic living stuff, like your clothes or refrigerator\u2014those are off-limits by law, I guess. \n\nThey can charge you for their services, but, like, how much really depends on your situation. There\u2019s some decent info on fees from Citizens Advice if you wanna check that out. \n\nIf you wanna get help or advice about bailiffs, there are places you can go, like National Debtline or Citizens Advice\u2014they're pretty useful. And complaining about a bailiff is totally a thing! If they treat you badly or don\u2019t follow the rules, you\u2019ve got grounds to kick up a fuss, and you can complain to whoever they\u2019re working for. \n\nThe process for complaining kinda depends on the type of bailiff, which might make it tricky, but you can do it! If you\u2019re dealing with a high court enforcement officer, you might have to go drama level and write to a judge, which sounds pretty formal. \n\nAnyway, if it's a local council situation, first complain to them and then the Ombudsman if you\u2019re still not happy\u2014just keep it rolling until you get someone to listen. And yeah, that\u2019s about it! Good luck with those bailiffs!",

      "poorly_written_article": "So, like, if you need help paying for childcare, there are a couple of ways to do it. First off, there's this thing called Tax-Free Childcare in the UK, which can help with those costs. Then there's free childcare for folks who are working in England, which is amazing, I guess. If you get specific benefits, there\u2019s actually free education and childcare for 2-year-olds under another program, which is kinda neat. \n\nNow, when we say \u2018approved childcare,\u2019 we mean any childcare that's done by some specific providers. It could be stuff like registered childminders, nannies, playschemes, nurseries, or clubs. And also schools and home care workers that are registered with an agency. So basically, if they\u2019re registered, you\u2019re good! \n\nThere\u2019s a guide available in Welsh too, if you know anyone needing that. The guidelines about how these providers get approved can change depending on where you\u2019re at in the UK, like England, Wales, Scotland, or Northern Ireland. You can check if a childcare provider is approved by looking through Ofsted for England or Care Inspectorate Wales for Wales. Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own inspectors, so you\u2019ll have to dig around a bit. \n\nNow, if you wanna claim that free childcare when you're working in England, make sure your person is on that Early Years Register. Just ask them about it, like no biggie. \n\nOh, and there\u2019s childcare stuff at school too! So, Tax-Free Childcare can cover care outside of school hours like after-school clubs, which is great because who doesn\u2019t need a break? If your kiddo hasn\u2019t even started school yet, you can still get help for nursery fees, but, like, you can\u2019t claim for things like what's required for compulsory education like, I dunno, mandatory classes or private lessons during school hours. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking at getting money for care from relatives while living in England or Scotland, you can only get Tax-Free Childcare if that relative is registered. For Northern Ireland, they need to be in some approval scheme and take care of other kids too. And just as a note, you can't get help for childcare from your partner because, well, that just doesn't count.\n\nIf you\u2019re a foster parent, there's this cool thing where you can claim for kids aged 9 months to 4 years old if you\u2019re working too. Just make sure your income is under a certain cap though... and talk to your social worker and local authority to figure it out. \n\nNow, on to the free childcare stuff! Here\u2019s the lowdown: all 3 to 4-year-olds in England can snag 570 free hours a year. They usually take it as 15 hours a week during the school year. Some kids even get 30 hours for free! You have to check if you're eligible, though. \n\nBut wait, there are extra costs with this free stuff. Like, you might have to pay for meals, extra hours, or trips\u2014it's not just all free, you know? Just ask your provider about those sneaky extra costs. \n\nIf you\u2019re getting benefits and have a two-year-old, they might even qualify for free childcare, assuming you meet some conditions. It\u2019s a good idea to check those details. If you don\u2019t qualify for free stuff but are working, you might still apply under a different scheme! If you\u2019re eligible for both freebies, well, you can only use one\u2014pick your poison.\n\nIf you\u2019re a non-UK citizen not entitled to benefits but still need help, don\u2019t stress! There\u2019s a chance you could still get free childcare if you\u2019re in England. Just check your income limits and savings allowances \u2013 it's a bit complicated but doable.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re already on tax credits, adding childcare costs could help too. When it comes to Universal Credit, you may be able to claim back a good chunk of your childcare costs, which is sweet. If you stop working, though, you better log in and update that info!\n\nThere are also childcare vouchers and employer schemes, which can help\u2014but only if you\u2019re already in those before a certain date. If you want to keep using your vouchers, make sure you do things by the book! \n\nIn addition, if you're studying, there are payments available like Care to Learn for young students under 20, and for older students in higher education. It's all about finding the right support, ya know?  \n\nSo yeah, there's a lot to sort through but help is out there if you look for it!",

This is because 85% of your costs is \u00a3195.50, which is above the maximum weekly amount.\n\nYou have to pay any remaining costs.\n\n## 2023 to 2024 academic year\n\nYou can get 85% of your childcare costs or a fixed maximum amount, whichever is less.\n\nThe maximum you can get is:\n\n  * up to \u00a3188.90 a week for 1 child\n\n  * up to \u00a3323.85 a week for 2 or more children\n\n\n\n\n## How you\u2019re paid\n\nYour grant will be paid into a Childcare Grant Payment Service (CCGPS) account. You\u2019ll get an email telling you how to set one up.\n\nYour childcare provider will send requests for payment to the CCGPS, which you can approve through your account. You\u2019ll usually need to do this every week. Your provider will be paid directly from the money in your account.\n\nYou can only approve payments to your childcare provider once your course has started. You cannot use the Childcare Grant to pay for upfront costs such as deposits.\n\nAny money that\u2019s left over at the end of the academic year will be returned to Student Finance England.\n\nIncome-related, unemployment and housing benefits are not affected by a Childcare Grant.\n\n## Eligibility \n\nTo qualify for a Childcare Grant all the following must apply:\n\n  * you\u2019re a full-time student\n  * your child must be under 15, or under 17 if they have special educational needs\n  * you get undergraduate student finance based on your household income (or are eligible for this)\n  * you\u2019re not getting a Postgraduate Loan\n  * you\u2019re a permanent resident in England\n  * your household income is less than \u00a319,795.23 - if you\u2019re applying for 1 child\n  * your household income is less than \u00a328,379.39 - if you\u2019re applying for 2 or more children\n  * neither you or your partner are claiming Tax-Free Childcare, the childcare element of working Tax Credit or Universal Credit\n  * neither you or your partner receive help with childcare costs from the NHS\n  * the children in your grant application are financially dependent on you\n  * your childcare provider is on the Ofsted Early Years Register or General Childcare Register - check with your provider\n\n\n\nIf your child is cared for at home, the carer cannot be a relative and must be registered with an appropriate body. Check with [Student Finance England](/contact-student-finance-england).\n\nA Childcare Grant is different to 15 or 30 hours free childcare. You cannot use it to pay for those hours.\n\n## How to apply \n\nTo apply for a Childcare Grant follow these steps:\n\n  1. Apply online as part of your main student finance application.\n\n  2. Send in evidence. You\u2019ll be told what evidence you need to provide when you apply.\n\n  3. You\u2019ll be sent a letter telling you how much Childcare Grant you\u2019ll get.\n\n  4. Create an online account with the Childcare Grant Payment Service (CCGPS). You\u2019ll get an email telling you how to set one up. Your grant will be paid into this account.\n\n\n\n\nUse the paper form instead if you:\n\n  * have already applied for student finance but didn\u2019t apply for a childcare grant at the same time\n  * want to apply for another child\n\n\n\nYou can download the form from the [student finance form finder](/student-finance-forms).\n\nUse your [student finance account](/student-finance-register-login) to send the form to Student Finance England, or send it by post.\n\nStudent Finance England   \nPO Box 210   \nDarlington   \nDL1 9HJ   \n\n  *[CCGPS]: Childcare Grant Payment Service\n  *[NHS]: National Health Service",

      "poorly_written_article": "Okay, so here\u2019s the deal with the Childcare Grant stuff. If you're a full-time student and you\u2019ve got kids who are under 15 (or under 17 if they need some extra help), you might be able to get some cash for your childcare. \n\nNow, this grant is pretty cool because you don\u2019t have to pay it back, which is awesome. It\u2019s like free money on top of what you already get as a student. Just a heads up though, if anything changes in your life or your classes and you get too much money, you might have to pay that back. So, stay on top of that.\n\nTo apply for this Childcare Grant, you have to be eligible for student finance first. Just remember that little nugget.\n\nAs for how much you can get? Well, it kinda depends on your household income and how many kids you have that need looking after. For the 2024 to 2025 school year things, you can get 85% of what you spend on childcare, but there's a cap on it.  Like, if you have one kid, you can get up to like \u00a3193.62 a week. If you have two or more, it goes up to \u00a3331.95 a week. Not too shabby, right? \n\nHere's a simple example. So if your childcare for one kid costs \u00a3100 a week, you\u2019ll get \u00a385. But if it costs \u00a3230, you just get capped at \u00a3193.62 because, you know, that\u2019s how the math works or whatever. You\u2019ll have to shell out some cash for anything above that cap though.\n\nAnd for the 2023 to 2024 year, it's pretty similar; you can still grab 85% but the max for one kid\u2019s just \u00a3188.90 and for two or more it\u2019s \u00a3323.85. So keep that in mind too. \n\nHow do you get the cash? It goes into this account called the Childcare Grant Payment Service (CCGPS), and you\u2019ll get an email on how to set it up. After that, your childcare person will ask for the money from your account and you gotta approve that, usually every week. Just a reminder though, you start approving payments only after your course kicks off, not for any upfront stuff like deposits.\n\nIf there\u2019s any leftover money at the end of the school year, back it goes to Student Finance England. Oh, and don\u2019t worry about your other benefits getting messed up because of this grant. \n\nTo qualify, just make sure you meet some basic requirements: you need to be a full-time student, your kid has to be under 15 (or 17 if they need special help), you need to be getting some sort of undergraduate help based on your family money situation, and not on a Postgrad loan. Also, you shouldn't be claiming Tax-Free Childcare or any NHS help for childcare. The kiddo you\u2019re getting this grant for needs to be relying on you for money, and your childcare provider needs to be legit, like on the Ofsted register or something. \n\nOh, and here\u2019s a fun fact: if you want to get this Childcare Grant, it\u2019s different from the free 15 or 30 hours of childcare stuff. Can\u2019t use it to cover those hours, just so you know!\n\nNow, if you wanna apply for this grant, it\u2019s super simple. First, jump online and do it as part of your regular student finance application. Then you\u2019ll need to send in some documents, they\u2019ll tell you what you need. You\u2019ll receive a letter saying how much you get, and then create that CCGPS account. \n\nIf you already applied for student finance but didn\u2019t get the childcare part, just grab a paper form instead and send that in. You can find that on their site too. \n\nWhen you send it in, make sure to send it to Student Finance England at that PO Box in Darlington, cause they won't accept anything else. \n\nSo there you go, that\u2019s the lowdown on the Childcare Grant. Hope it helps a bit!",

YOU might be able to get this AMAZING financial help with your childcare costs! And guess what? This GRANT, guys, it doesn\u2019t have to be paid back, like how awesome is that?! But hold on, don\u2019t celebrate just yet \u2013 if your situation changes (which can totally happen, like you\u2019d be surprised!) you might need to cough up some money back!

For example, if your childcare for one child costs \u00a3100 a week, you\u2019ll get \u00a385, but if it costs \u00a3230, you\u2019ll only get \u00a3193.62 because that\u2019s the maximum.",

You can only get a fixed maximum amount, which is, like, totally gonna be the lower of the two! So, like, if you've only got one kid, you might get up to \u00a3193.62 for the week, which is more than enough 'cause kids are EXPENSIVE, but if you have two or more, you could snag up to \u00a3331.95 weekly! Like, imagine \u2013 if your childcare is a chill \u00a3100 a week, you'd get back a totally cool \u00a385! But if you're getting charged \u00a3230 for that one kid, you're still only getting \u00a3193.62 because it\u2019s the MAX amount (which reminds me of the time I had to deal with this once, lol!)!

Your childcare provider (who I hope is not a total nightmare, right?!) is going to send their payment requests to CCGPS, and you\u2019re just gonna approve them from your account \u2013 it\u2019s usually a weekly thing, because that keeps it interesting!

      "poorly_written_article": "So, uh, like, if you wanna see if you can get some student finance, it's kinda important to check if you qualify first, you know? There\u2019s this whole different process just if you're from places like Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland. You even got Jersey, Guernsey, and Isle of Man in the mix, which is like, super confusing. Just check out their links if that\u2019s your deal.\n\nNext up, figure out how much money you might get in loans for tuition and maintenance. It kinda depends on whether you\u2019re a new student, continuing student, part-timer, or someone who started school before this August in 2016. Maintenance loans depend on where you're studying and your household income - so don\u2019t forget that!\n\nOh, and there's this handy student finance calculator you can use to estimate how much you could get. But remember, any loan you get? Yeah, you gotta pay that back eventually, so keep that in mind. Check out how much and when you'll start repayments too.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking you might need some extra cash, you could qualify if you\u2019re under 25 and don\u2019t talk to your parents or if you pay for childcare or if you\u2019re a full-time student with kids. Also, if you\u2019re taking care of someone financially or have a disability, you might get some extra help. Seriously, there\u2019s other financial stuff from your uni too, so just do some digging.\n\nNow, about applying \u2013 it's good to know when you can apply and what ID stuff you need. And yeah, sometimes they wanna see proof of household income, so be ready for that.\n\nYou can totally apply online - just create an account if you\u2019re a newbie or log in if you\u2019re returning. They say it could take up to 6 weeks to get it processed, and ya might need to send some extra documents. \n\nIf you\u2019re just after a tuition fee loan, you\u2019ll have to use a paper form and send it by post 'cause you can't do that online. But hey, if you're stuck and can\u2019t apply online, this is how you go. Same 6 weeks thing though, just so you know.\n\nIf anything changes while you\u2019re doing this student thing, like if you switch courses or end up living somewhere new, you gotta update that info, okay? Just check how to do that online later.\n\nOnce you\u2019re all registered at uni or whatever, your maintenance loan usually drops into your bank at the start of terms. So, you can use your student finance account to update stuff like your bank details and see how much you're getting and when.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to reapply for finance every year since things can change, which might affect your loans. Just keep your details fresh, like if your income changes or you switch bank accounts. \n\nWhen you\u2019re done with studying, they\u2019ll make an account for repayments for you, which is nice. Just make sure your contact info is right, so you can access it with the same login you had before. But you gotta update things like if you leave the UK for over 3 months. \n\nAnd yeah, don\u2019t forget to check how much you\u2019ll owe while you're repaying because that\u2019s also important, just saying. It can be a lot to keep track of, but you got this!",

There\u2019s stuff like Tax-Free Childcare, tax credits, and Universal Credit, which is kinda like free money depending on your situation, and you can also get help while you're studying if, I dunno, you're trying to juggle school and kids. \n\nOh! And don't forget that you can get free childcare when your kid is between like 9 months and 4 years old. But there are requirements like you need to be getting certain benefits or whatever.

You can either find a recruitment agency to help you out (which might cost some cash but hey, they know what they\u2019re doing), or you can just do it yourself. That'll give you the fun challenge of sifting through resumes. \n\nBut remember, you have to be fair when you're hiring people. Discrimination is a big no-no! So make sure your hiring process is all about giving everyone a fair shot, especially people with disabilities or health issues. Gotta keep it accessible, ya know? \n\nNext, make sure the person you're considering can actually work in the UK. Like, they need the right stuff to work legally. There's even a way to check if they can do that. Pretty straightforward really. \n\nAlso, if the person is gonna be working with kids or in healthcare or whatever, you might need a DBS check on them\u2014that's just a criminal record thing to keep things safe, you know? Just check out if that\u2019s something you need. \n\nThen, there\u2019s the whole workplace pension deal. You have to figure out if they need to be in a pension plan. If it\u2019s your first time hiring someone, there's info for that, and if you already got employees, there\u2019s info for that too. It\u2019s like two routes to consider. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve got someone on board, it\u2019s crucial to agree on a contract and their salary. So when they say \"yes, I\u2019ll work for you!\" you need something written down. You should check what the minimum wage is because it changes depending on age and job types, so don't get caught paying less than you should, okay? \n\nOh, and don\u2019t forget to tell HMRC about your new employee before they get their first paycheck. That's super important, otherwise you might get in trouble. You\u2019ll need their personal deets and a P45 to sort out tax codes\u2014if you don\u2019t have the P45, there's this starter checklist thing you can use.
