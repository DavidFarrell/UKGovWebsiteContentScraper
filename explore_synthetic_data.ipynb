You qualify for this magical land known as the apprentice rate - sounds fancy, huh? But hold your horses! If you’re hitting that big two-oh and have like, popped your cherry on your first year, it’s time to graduate to the real-deal minimum wage that fits your advanced age because, believe it or not, age matters in this money game!\n",

Then you've got those super noble volunteers doing their thing WITHOUT, like, cash flow, or even our brave men and women in the armed forces who just don’t fit into this whole minimum wage picture – wild, right? And hey, if somebody claims to be giving you an ‘internship’ – which, by the way, is often code for, 'I just don’t want to pay you' – you should really involve yourself in a deep dive investigation because like, who’s to say they’re not just trying to pull a fast one?\n",
